@@ This was created to counter-act the subset of trolls that get a kick

@@ Essentially add their wildcarded DNS site to &SITES.  If you have IP only
@@ then use the IP, it's fine.  If you have a 'good' player, add their 
@@ dbref# to &EXEMPT and it'll bypass them from being medusa'd.

@@ &EXEMPT and &SITES are both space seaprated lists.
