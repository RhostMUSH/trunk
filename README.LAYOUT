This is the following layout:
rhost_installer.sh      -- Only used if you need to pull RhostMUSH for the first time.
                           If you see the directories below, ignore it.  Trust me.
DevTools/  		-- currently unused
Plugins/  		-- currently unused 
rhost_installer.sh*	-- The installsetup script.  Not needed
                           if you have actually grabbed the tarball or if
                           you downloaded the latest git repository.
                           Use patch.sh to update the source tree once received.
Contrib/  		-- currently unused
Mushcode/  		-- currently unused
Server/			-- the main RhostMUSH directory.  To configure you
                           would issue 'make confsource' from this directory
