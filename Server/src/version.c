   2.0
   All known bugs fixed with disk-based.  Played with gdbm, it
   sucked.  Now using bsd 4.4 hash stuff.
*/

/* 1.12
   All known bugs fixed after several days of debugging 1.10/1.11.
   Much string-handling braindeath patched, but needs a big overhaul,
   really.   GAC 2/10/91
*/

/* 1.11
   Fixes for 1.10.  (@name didn't call do_name, etc.)
   Added dexamine (debugging examine, dumps the struct, lots of info.)
*/

/* 1.10
  Finally got db2newdb working well enough to run from the big (30000
  object) db with ATR_KEY and ATR_NAME defined.   GAC 2/3/91
