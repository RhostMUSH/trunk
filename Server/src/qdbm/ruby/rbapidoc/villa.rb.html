<h1>API of villa</h1>
<hr />
<dl>
<dt><kbd>require 'villa'</kbd></dt>
<dd>
The library `villa' should be included in application codes.
An instance of the class `Villa' is used as a database handle.
`Villa' performs Mix-in of `Enumerable'.
Each method of `Villa' throws an exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes when an error
occurs: `Villa::ENOERR', `Villa::EFATAL', `Villa::EMODE', `Villa::EBROKEN', `Villa::EKEEP',
`Villa::ENOITEM', `Villa::EALLOC', `Villa::EMAP', `Villa::EOPEN', `Villa::ECLOSE',
`Villa::ETRUNC', `Villa::ESYNC', `Villa::ESTAT', `Villa::ESEEK', `Villa::EREAD',
`Villa::EWRITE', `Villa::ELOCK', `Villa::EUNLINK', `Villa::EMKDIR', `Villa::ERMDIR' and
`Villa::EMISC'.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>villa = Villa::new(name, omode, cmode)</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Constructor: Get a database handle.
`name' specifies the name of a database file.
`omode' specifies the connection mode: `Villa::OWRITER' as a writer, `Villa::OREADER' as a
reader.  If the mode is `Villa::OWRITER', the following may be added by bitwise or:
`Villa::OCREAT', which means it creates a new database if not exist, `Villa::OTRUNC', which
means it creates a new database regardless if one exists, `Villa::OZCOMP', which means
leaves in the database are compressed with ZLIB, `Villa::OYCOMP', which means leaves in the
database are compressed with LZO, `Villa::OXCOMP', which means leaves in the database are
compressed with BZIP2.  Both of `Villa::OREADER' and `Villa::OWRITER' can be added to by
bitwise or: `Villa::ONOLCK', which means it opens a database file without file locking, or
`Villa::OLCKNB', which means locking is performed without blocking.  If it is omitted,
`Villa::OREADER' is specified.
`cmode' specifies the comparing function: `Villa::CMPLEX' comparing keys in lexical order,
`Villa::CMPDEC' comparing keys as decimal strings, `Villa::CMPOBJ' comparing keys as
serialized objects implementing the method `&lt;=&gt;'.  The comparing function should be kept
same in the life of a database.  If `Villa::CMPOBJ' is used, such methods as `put', `out',
`get' and so on can treat not only instances of `String' but also any serializable and
comparable object.
If so, objects being stored are serialized and objects being retrieved are deserialized.
The return value is the database handle.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.
If a block parameter is given, this method works as an iterator.  A database handle is
opened and passed via the first argument of the block.  The database handle is surely
closed when the block is over.
While connecting as a writer, an exclusive lock is invoked to the database file.
While connecting as a reader, a shared lock is invoked to the database file.  The thread
blocks until the lock is achieved.  `Villa::OZCOMP', `Villa::OYCOMP', and `Villa::OXCOMP'
are available only if QDBM was built each with ZLIB, LZO, and BZIP2 enabled.  If
`Villa::ONOLCK' is used, the application is responsible for exclusion control.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>villa = Villa::open(name, omode, cmode)</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Constructor: An alias of `new'.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>bool = villa.close()</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Close the database handle.
The return value is always true.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.
Because the region of a closed handle is released, it becomes impossible to use the handle.
Updating a database is assured to be written when the handle is closed.  If a writer opens
a database but does not close it appropriately, the database will be broken.  If the
transaction is activated and not committed, it is aborted.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>villa.silent = bool</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Set the flag whether to repress frequent exceptions.
The return value is the assigned value.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>bool = villa.put(key, val, dmode)</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Store a record.
`key' specifies a key.  Although it must be an instance of String, binary data is okey.
`val' specifies a value.  Although it must be an instance of String, binary data is okey.
`dmode' specifies behavior when the key overlaps, by the following values: `Villa::DOVER',
which means the specified value overwrites the existing one, `Villa::DKEEP', which means the
existing value is kept, `Villa::DCAT', which means the specified value is concatenated at the
end of the existing value, `Villa::DDUP', which means duplication of keys is allowed and the
specified value is added as the last one, `Villa::DDUPR', which means duplication of keys is
allowed and the specified value is added as the first one.  If it is omitted, `Villa::DOVER'
is specified.
The return value is always true.  However, if the silent flag is true and replace is
cancelled, false is returned instead of exception.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs or replace
is cancelled.
The cursor becomes unavailable due to updating database.

corresponds.
When the key of duplicated records is specified, the value of the first record of the same
key is selected.  The cursor becomes unavailable due to updating database.

<dd>
Method: Retrieve a record.
`key' specifies a key.  Although it must be an instance of String, binary data is okey.
The return value is an instance of the value of the corresponding record.  If the silent flag
is true and no record corresponds, nil is returned instead of exception.
When the key of duplicated records is specified, the first record of the same key is
deleted.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs or no record
corresponds.

<dd>
Method: Move the cursor to a position around a record.
`key' specifies a key.  Although it must be an instance of String, binary data is okey.
`jmode' specifies detail adjustment: `Villa::JFORWARD', which means that the cursor is set
to the first record of the same key and that the cursor is set to the next substitute if
completely matching record does not exist, `Villa::JBACKWARD', which means that the cursor
is set to the last record of the same key and that the cursor is set to the previous

An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs or there is
no record corresponding the condition.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>str = villa.curkey()</kbd></dt>

before the current record, `Villa::CPAFTER', which means that a new record is inserted after

`nidxmax' specifies the max number of indexes in a non-leaf node of B+ tree.  If it is not
more than 0, the default value is specified.
`lcnum' specifies the max number of caching leaf nodes.  If it is not more than 0, the
default value is specified.
`ncnum' specifies the max number of caching non-leaf nodes.  If it is not more than 0, the

An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.
The default setting is equivalent to `vlsettuning(49, 192, 1024, 512)'.  Because tuning
parameters are not saved in a database, you should specify them every opening a database.

<dd>
Method: Synchronize updating contents with the file and the device.
The return value is always true.

<dd>
Method: Optimize the database.
The return value is always true.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.

dispensable regions accumulate.  This method is useful to do away with them.  This method
should not be used while the transaction is activated.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>num = villa.fsiz()</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Get the size of the database file.
The return value is the size of the database file.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>bool = villa.tranbegin()</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Begin the transaction.
The return value is always true.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.

of the transaction.  Only one transaction can be activated with a database handle at the
same time.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><kbd>bool = villa.trancommit()</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Commit the transaction.
The return value is always true.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.
Updating a database in the transaction is fixed when it is committed successfully.  Any
other thread except for the one which began the transaction should not call this method.

<dt><kbd>bool = villa.tranabort()</kbd></dt>
<dd>
Method: Abort the transaction.
The return value is always true.
An exception of `Villa::EANY' or its sub classes is thrown if an error occurs.

began the transaction should not call this method.
