         functions like switch() may take.  MAX_ARGS is currently defaulted to

mail/write +feditall=old,new - modify ALL matches on ALL lines.

imm_nomod - when enabled (default disabled) specifies that only immortal can
            set/unset the NOMODIFY flag and only immortals can modify things

create() didn't check command permissions first for @dig, @open, and @pcreate
put a temp fix for a possible SIGSEGV bug.
