# netrhost.conf - RhostMUSH default override configuration file
# 
# NOTE:  All entries in this file are not necessarily default values.
#        These are recommended options that the developers find help
#        run starting games easier.  We provide the options different
#        from the main 'default' values for our own tweaks and optimizations.
#        You may keep them as they are or alter them as you see fit.
#
#        The values in the hardcode remain the default values for both
#        historical reasons as well as for backward compatibility to
#        existing codebases.  So surprises do not occur to players who
#        have expected the values to be that way for 27 years and suddenly
#        question why all their code broke on an update.
#
#        You may verify the default values in the source file conf.c
#        if you feel brave.

# --- Define reality levels here
#     Syntax:  reality_level <8 char name> <32 bit int mask> <32 char opt desc attrib>
#     Examples: reality_level Testing 32768
#               reality_level Testing2 16384 TESTDESC
#               reality_level Testing3 0x00008000 TESTDESC2
#      
#     - First example uses default 'DESC' attribute, second uses user-defined TESTDESC
#     - 'Real' must be defined as '1'
#     - Must compile with -REALITY_LEVELS to make this work.
#
#     Note:  You can use the literal hex value for reality levels if you wish
#
# reality_level Real         0x00000001
# reality_level Umbra        0x00000002 UMBRADESC
