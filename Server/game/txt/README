Q:  How do I put color in these files?
A1: Look at ansi.h and you need to put the literal ASCII codes.
    They will look like: ^[[0m (for ANSI_NORMAL).  That's <ESC>[
A2: You can enable ansi_txtfiles then use %c (or %x/%m) encoding
    for ansi, however you compiled your Rhost. 

Q:  I want to design my own txt files to read in the mush.
A:  Easy.  Design them like help.txt would be set up, mkindx the file,
    then you can access it via @dynhelp online.

Q:  Do I have to mkindx these files whenever I make changes?
A:  Only the ones that have '& ' index. (help.txt, wizhelp.txt, news.txt, etc)

Q:  Do I have to @readcache in the game whenever I make a change?
A:  Only when you modify any of the files listed in this README.  Not the ones
    you use with @dynhelp.

Q:  Can't I just make code in the mush that then is used for these silly txt files?
A:  Absolutely.  Check 'wizhelp file_object'.
