& +help
  If enabled (please check @list options), this will work just like normal
  'help' does, but for +help.  This is intended for TINY/MUX compatibility
  and is disabled by default.
  
  The /search switch works for +help as well.
  
& co
& cd
& ch
  Command: co <name> <password>
           cd <name> <password>
           ch <name> <password>
  
  These commands are only useful on the connect screen.  They are used to
  connect to your account <name> with the provided <password>.  There are
  currently three methods to do so.
  
  They are as follows:
     co  -- This option is the default and normal method to connect.
            This option has no special conditions or privilages.
     ch  -- Wizards and anyone with the NOWHO @power (to @hide) can use this.
            This option will auto-hide the player when connecting.
            It defaults to the 'co' option if you can't @hide.
     cd  -- Wizards and higher can use this to connect dark to the game.
            This effectively connects wiz-cloaked to the game.
            Immortals get auto-added to supercloak.

& SQL
  SQL is available in two flavors in RhostMUSH, both are built in and both can
  be ran at the same time.  
  
  SQLITE:  
  This is a 'lite' form of SQL.  It has a good solid base, but doesn't offer
  some of the more advanced features that MySQL/MariaDB has.  The hosting
  server must have a workign SQLITE library to successfully link to and use
  this database offering.
  
  MySQL/MariaDB:
  This is an advanced form of SQL.  It allows all the feature-rich
  capabilities of a fully function SQL engine.  The hosting server must have
  mysql or mariadb to be able to link to and use this offering.
  
  See Also: sqlite_query(), @sql, @sqlconnect, @sqldisconnect, sql(), sqlon,
            sqloff(), sqlping()

& CLUSTERS
  Clusters are a method to have 1 or more real dbref#'s defined as a single
  virtual 'container' or entity to house attributes.  Using cluster related
  commands and functions, you can target any dbref# contained in a cluster
  and it will reference the cluster as a whole.  This is useful for shared
  attribute storage, large data warehousing, or role play/player based
  statistical information where you need a large variety of attributes
  to be housed over a period of time.  The attributes are written to
  the cluster in a weighted method and not a round robin where the item
  in the cluster chosen is always the one with the least number of 
  attributes.
  
  Clusters require wizard access to create, but can be added to by the
  cluster themselves.  You must control both the cluster and the item
  to be added to the cluster to add to the cluster.
  
  See Also:  @cluster, cluster functions

& CLUSTER COMMANDS
  Currently the only cluster command is @cluster.  This topic is intended
  for future growth of the cluster environment.
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster functions
  
& SETQ_TEMPLATES
  You can specify 'templates' for setq registers to automatically have 
  pre-defined labels for each individual object.  This is done by setting
  a string in the attribute 'SETQ_TEMPLATE' on the object.  The attribute
  should be in the format:  <register>:<string>
  
  So an example would be:   0:foobar 1:xyzzy q:myqreg
  
  This would set a template on an object where it would preassign the
  label 'foobar' to register 0, 'xyzzy' to register 1, and 'myqreg' to
  register q.
  
  Note:  These are only useful for the immediate calling $commands.
  They are not transversed through u() functions, @triggers, or other
  action based events.
  
  You may redefine these labels as you would normally with nameq(), 
  setq(), or setr().
  
  See Also: nameq(), setq(), setr()
  
& #LAMBDA
  Object type: #lambda
  
  In any function that accepts #obj/attr pairs, you may substitute the
  object dbref# with '#lambda'.  This basically says 'take the string after
  as a literal and not an attribute'.
  
  For example:
    > @va #123=Testing
    Set.
    > say get(#123/va)
    You say "Testing"
    > say get(#lambda/va)
    You say "va"
    > say u(#lambda/Testing: %%0,Boo!)
    You say "Testing: Boo!"
    
& SINGLETHREADING
  You can accomplish 'single-threading' $commands by setting the attribute
  on the object SINGLETHREAD.  Once set, you must have at the end of the
  processing a way to set the attribute !NO_COMMAND, else that $command
  will no longer be executable until the attribute's NO_COMMAND flag is
  removed.
  
  You may globally set the attribute SINGLETHREAD as well.
  
& BANG NOTATION
  Bang notation allows you to use '!' and '!!' in functions for 'not' and
  'not-not' functionality.  This works similiarilly to the C equivelant of
  using 'bangs'.  You may also specify '!$' and '!!$' for FALSE or TRUE
  conditions on functions that return string values.  Finally, you may
  specify '!^' and '!!^' for true-boolean FALSE or TRUE conditions on
  functions that return true-boolean based on the function t()'.
  
  
  Example:
    > say match(one two three four five,four)
    You say "4"
    > say !match(one two three four five,four)
    You say "0"
    > say !!match(one two three four five,four)
    You say "1"
    > say !!$grab(this is a test,was)
    You say "0"
    > say !!$grab(this is a test,this)
    You say "1"
    > say !!^space(1000)                  (spaces are non-boolean strings)
    You say "0"
    > say !!$space(1000)                  (spaces are not-null strings)
    You say "1" 
  
  Bang notation may or may not be enabled based on the RhostMUSH that you are
  on.  Please check @list options to see if it is currently enabled.
  
& VARIABLE EXITS
  Variable exits are done somewhat differently than Penn and TinyMUSH3.  First,
  it doesn't matter where the exit is linked to (though we suggest you do link
  it somewhere *grin*).  You then @toggle the exit VARIABLE.  It will then 
  check the @exitto attribute on the exit for the destination.  If the 
  destination is not a valid location ('home' or a valid dbref# that can be 
  linked to) it will fail to allow the target through the exit and return an 
  error message.
  
  See Also: @exitto, variable toggle
  
& REALITY LEVELS
  RhostMUSH supports reality levels.  To see if the rhostmush you are on has
  them currently enabled, please check @list options.  Reality levels are
  useful for multiple views for permissions.   This is exceptionally handy
  when dealing with role play environments where various races, guilds, or
  special beings require special views, looks, descriptions, or other
  permission levels.  An example would be the World of Darkness umbra.
  
& SIDEEFFECTS
  RhostMUSH supports side-effect functions.  This has to be enabled by
  the site owner before they can be used.  In addition, due to the many
  security issues that arise from using side-effects, before the 
  function is accessable, it must be set SIDEFX.
  
  Please check @list options to see if side effects are enabled and
  what side effects are enabled of the list.  list(), being relatively
  harmless in how it's coded, is omitted from the restrictions 
  found with normal side-effects.
  
  MUX and PENN style sideeffects are both supported.  Support for the
  force(), trigger() and wait() functions found in TinyMUSH 3.0 will 
  NOT be supported ever.  They're silly functions to add and the
  security issues involved with these functions are too large to ignore.
  
  NOTE:  Side-effects are generally frowned upon and should not be used
         at all.  This was only done for compatibility.
  
  Type '@list options' to see what side-effects are currently in effect.
    
  MUX sideeffects supported:   TEL, SET, PEMIT, CREATE, LIST, and LINK
  PENN sideeffects supported:  TEL, SET, PEMIT, CREATE, LINK, DIG, OPEN, EMIT,
                               LEMIT, OEMIT, CLONE, LOCK, PARENT, NAME,
                               WIPE, ZEMIT, and REMIT
  OTHER sideeffects supported: DESTROY, TOGGLE, TXLEVEL, RXLEVEL, RSET, 
                               and MOVE
  DATABASE sideeffects supported: SQLITE_QUERY
  
  Help is available on MUX, PENN and OTHER side-effects by name.
  
& ALT INVENTORIES
  RhostMUSH has the option of allowing alternate inventories.  Alternate
  inventories are seen by the 'worn' and 'wielded' commands.  There are
  various ways to configure this that wizards have to do but to see what
  is currently allowed on the mush, type '@list options' and it'll be
  listed in that information.  Items that are wielded will have to be
  toggled WIELDED (by a wizard) and items that are worn will have to
  be toggled WORN (by a wizard).  Sorry, there are no 'wield' or 'wear'
  commands to wield weapons or wear equipment.  It was felt this would
  be too limiting for various enviornments so look to see if there
  exists a specialized +wear or +wield on the mush you are on or talk
  to a local staff about this feature.
  
& ALTNAMES
  RhostMUSH allows alternate names of items.  This is done through the
  '@altname' attribute.  If you pass the lock for altnames (@lock/altname)
  then you will see the true name of the object followed by the altname
  in {}'s.  An example would be:  Book(#123) {Tome}
  
  Both @altname and @lock/altname are wizard only.
  
  This will only effect look.  If you try to reference the altname of 
  the item with any other command, it will not recognize it as a valid
  name.  This is meant to avoid abusiveness.
  
  See Also: look
  
& SENSES
  Senses are the five senses that a human has (keeping 6th sense or other
  perceptuary abilities out of the loop).  These senses are re-enacted with
  the five following commands.
        LOOK   - allows you to view things (mush standard)
                 @desc     - what enactor sees.
                 @adesc    - action that occurs.
                 @odesc    - what everyone but enactor sees.
        TOUCH  - allows you to touch things with following reactions.
                 @stouch   - what enactor sees.
                 @satouch  - action that occurs.
                 @sotouch  - what everyone but enactor sees.
        TASTE  - allows you to taste things with following reactions.
                 @staste   - what enactor sees.
                 @sataste  - action that occurs.
                 @sotaste  - what everyone but enactor sees.
        LISTEN - allows you to hear things with following reactions.
                 @slisten  - what enactor sees.
                 @salisten - action that occurs.
                 @solisten - what everyone but enactor sees.
        SMELL  - allows you to smell things with following reactions.
                 @ssmell   - what enactor sees.
                 @sasmell  - action that occurs.
                 @sosmell  - what everyone but enactor sees.

& VATOVZ
  Command: @va[/<switch>] <object>=<string>
           ...
           @vz[/<switch>] <object>=<string>
  
  This sets attributes VA - VZ (with @va - @vz) on the target object.
  This is in effect just like &VA or &VZ but is provided for older MUSH
  backward compatibility.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  See Also: & 
  
& ZATOZZ
  Command: @za[/<switch>] <object>=<string>
           ...
           @zz[/<switch>] <object>=<string>
  
  This sets attributes ZA - ZZ (with @za - @zz) on the target object.
  This is in effect just like &ZA or &ZZ but is provided for older MUSH
  backward compatibility.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  See Also: &
 
& $-commands
  Please check help on 'ARBITRARY COMMANDS'.  
  
  However, you should be aware that RhostMUSH comes default with $commands
  *NOT* working on players.  Talk to your local administration to see if 
  this option has been enabled or disabled.
  
  See Also: ARBITRARY COMMANDS
  
& colors
  
  RhostMUSH has your standard ANSI sequences and colors.  These can be
  gotten by using the ansi() function, or by using the '%c' substitution.
  You are incapable of seeing ansi sequences without having the ANSI
  flag set.  Furthermore, you are incapable of seeing color without
  having the ANSICOLOR flag set.  Help is available on both of these
  flags.   Please note, that the functions of '%c' and '%x' can be switched
  at runtime.  Check @list options to see which is which.
  
  Do note that if your terminal is not able to display ansi codes, then
  you will not notice any change with either flag.
  
  For more help on the %c substitution, look at SUBSTITUTIONS
  
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS, ANSI, ANSICOLOR, XTERMCOLOR, ANSI()
  
& zones
  The RhostMUSH zone system works as follows:
  
  A zone is held together by a Zone Master. A Zone Master is an object or
  room that has it's ZONEMASTER flag set. Once the flag is set, you may
  do several things. To start with, you may decide you want others to
  be able to have their objects join your zone. To do this set up a 
  ZoneToLock on your ZONEMASTER. This lock defaults to false unlike most
  other locks which default to true if they are missing.
 
  You may also want select few people to have control over objects in your
  zone. These people will have wizard-like control within your zone.
  To allow others control and modification ability to objects in your
  zone you would set a ZoneWizLock on your zone master. This lock defaults
  to false if missing (allowing no-one control). Note that you as an owner
  of the zone master must still give yourself explicit zone wizard status
  by putting yourself in the lock.
  
  You may also set a ZONEMASTER, ZONECONTENTS.  This flag will enable
  searching the contents of the Zone Master for matching $commands.
  
  You may also set a ZONEMASTER, ZONEPARENT.  This allows the zonemaster
  to allow its children to inherit attributes off the ZONEMASTER.  An object
  @toggled NOZONEPARENT will not inherit attributes from any zonemaster.
     
  { Type 'help zones2' for more info. }
  
& zones2
  You may also want a VERY select few to be able to alter the zone master
  object itself. To do this set a TwinkLock on the zone master. This lock
  defaults to false. 
  
  Any commands that you place on your zone master object will be searched
  for by objects or players entering commands that are not matched on
  an object local to them if they are essentially in a room of your zone.
  Essentially in your zone means that they or any level of container that
  they are within is physically in a room that is zoned to your zone master.
  The parent of a zone master is not searched for commands when this
  command search occurs.
 
  Once you have set up your zone master, you (or anyone in your 
  zone master's ZoneToLock) may begin to add objects to your zone.
  To do this, use the @zone/add, @zone/del, and @zone/purge commands.
 
  See Also: @zone, @lock, lzone(), ZONEMASTER, ZONECONTENTS, ZONEPARENT
  
& @zone
 Usage:
  1) @zone <object or zonemaster>
  2) @zone/add <object>=<zonemaster>
  3) @zone/del <object or zonemaster>=<zonemaster or object>
  4) @zone/purge <object or zonemaster>
  
  The @zone command adds and removes zone master entries from objects.
  An object may be a member of multiple zones.
 
  * Usage 1 will list the zones an object belongs to, or the objects that
    belong to a zonemaster.
  * Usage 2 will add a zone to an object.
  * Usage 3 will delete an object from a zone, or zone from an object. These
    are essentially the same, but from different directions.
  * Usage 4 will remove all references to zones from an object or
    zone master.

& changes
  For a list of actual changes, see 'help revis'.
  
  RhostMUSH, first originating in 1989/1990, was founded as a TinyMUD.
  Though the current code runs a MUSH compatible kernal, we still use
  the exact same database from that period.  You will find RhostMUSH
  is nothing like a MUD, MUSH or a MUSE.  It is a hybrid of many systems.
  The coders for RhostMUSH have put a lot of effort into adding changes 
  and modifying the server.  You will find that pretty much any code 
  will work properly here on RhostMUSH.  Another major change is error 
  messages are randomized.  So if you see something strange, you're 
  not being spoofed.  Also, if you notice a strange response, don't 
  think it's a problem.  Talk to a staff person as the option you 
  may be trying may be disabled.
  
  The list of changes done to this server goes beyond any document
  can describe.  The only resemblance this has to TinyMUSH or any
  other variety of server is in its backward compatibility with
  how it parses and functionality returns.

& drop
  Command: drop[/<switch>] <object>
           drop[/<switch>] <exit>
 
  The first form removes <object> from your inventory and puts it in your
  location, except for the following special cases: Dropping a STICKY thing
  sends it home, and dropping a thing in a room with a drop-to sends the thing
  to the drop-to location.
 
  The second form removes <exit> from your list of exits and adds it to the
  list of exits for the current location.  Anyone in the same location as
  you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's destination.  You can
  only drop exits when you own the location where you are dropping them.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @odrop/@adrop attributes on the dropped
                 object.  This switch only works if you control the object.
   
  'throw' is the same as 'drop'.
  
  See Also: get, @adrop, @drop, @odrop, DROP-TO, STICKY
  
& enter
  Command: enter[/<switch>] <object>
  The enter command is used to enter an object. Insides of objects are best
  used for vehicles, or storage spaces when you don't have a home (or even
  as a floating home).  In order to enter an object you must either own it or
  it must have its ENTER_OK flag set, and you must also pass the object's
  EnterLock (if it has one).
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @oenter/@aenter or @oefail/@aefail
                attributes on the entered object, and don't perform the
                @oxleave attribute on your current location.  This switch
                only works if you control the object being entered.
 
  See Also: leave, @aefail, @aenter, @efail, @enter, @idesc, @lock, @oefail,
            @oenter, @oxleave, ENTER_OK
  
& examine
  Command: examine[/<switches>] <object>[/<wild-attrib>]
  
  Displays all available information about <object>.  <object> may be an
  object, 'me' or 'here'. You must control the object to examine it, or it
  must be set VISUAL.  If you do not own the object, you will just see the
  name of the object's owner, and optionally any public attributes and 
  attributes owned by you set on the object.
 
  If an attribute is owned by a player other than the owner of the object,
  the number of the attribute owner is shown in parentheses immediately
  following the attribute name.  Flag letters may appear in parentheses also,
  to indicate the status of the attribute.  The list of flag letters that
  show up is shown in 'help examine2'
  
{ 'help examine2' for more }
  
& examine2
  The following flag letters show up with attributes when examined:
    + - The attribute is locked, it does not change ownership when the
        object is @chowned and may not be modified.
    $ - The attribute is not checked when looking for $-commands.  Note
        that the predefined attributes DESC, IDESC, ODESC, FAIL, OFAIL,
        SUCC, OSUCC, DROP, ODROP, SEX, and CHARGES are never checked.
    I - This attribute is not inherited by children of the object.
    V - The attribute is visible to anyone who examines you.  Note that
        the predefined attributes DESC, SEX, and LAST are always VISUAL.
    N - The attribute will not be @cloned.
    n - The attribute will not evaluate %0-%9 ($commands only)
    s - The attribute can not be removed/wiped.
    u - The attribute is set up to handle attribute-based uselocks.
    M - The attribute is dark/inaccessable to anyone below wizard.
    p - The attribute is INVISIBLE but accessable to anyone below wizard.
    G - The attribute is modifiable by #1 only.
    i - The attribute is modifiable by Immortal or higher only.
    W - The attribute is modifiable by Wizard (Royalty) or higher only.
    a - The attribute is modifiable by Councilor (admin) or higher only.
    B - The attribute is modifiable by Architect or higher only.
    g - The attribute is modifiable by Guildmaster or higher only.
  
{ 'help examine3' for more }
  
& examine3
  If expanded looks are enabled (@list options to verify), you may also
  see global attributes on attributes.  These are surrounded by []'s.
  The following global attributes can exist:
    + - The attribute is locked, it does not change ownership when the
        object is @chowned and may not be modified.
    $ - The attribute is not checked when looking for $-commands.  Note
        that the predefined attributes DESC, IDESC, ODESC, FAIL, OFAIL,
        SUCC, OSUCC, DROP, ODROP, SEX, and CHARGES are never checked.
    I - This attribute is not inherited by children of the object.
    V - The attribute is visible to anyone who examines you.  Note that
        the predefined attributes DESC, SEX, and LAST are always VISUAL.
    N - The attribute will not be @cloned.
    n - The attribute will not evaluate %0-%9 ($commands only)
    s - The attribute can not be removed/wiped.
    u - The attribute is set up to handle attribute-based uselocks.
    M - The attribute is dark/inaccessable to anyone below wizard.
    p - The attribute is INVISIBLE but accessable to anyone below wizard.
    G - The attribute is modifiable by #1 only.
    i - The attribute is modifiable by Immortal or higher only.
    W - The attribute is modifiable by Wizard (Royalty) or higher only.
    a - The attribute is modifiable by Councilor (admin) or higher only.
    B - The attribute is modifiable by Architect or higher only.
    g - The attribute is modifiable by Guildmaster or higher only.
  
{ 'help examine4' for more }
& examine4
  If you specify a wildcarded attribute name, then only those attributes
  that match are shown.  So, 'exam me/v?' will show all your attributes that
  start with v and are two characters long.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /brief  - Show everything but the attributes.
     /quick  - When examining an object you don't control, show only the
               owner's name. 
     /full   - When examining an object you don't control, show any public
               attributes set on the object in addition to the owner's name.
     /parent - Includes attributes that are not present on the object itself
               but which are inherited from the object's parent.  This only
               works if you have permission to see it.
     /tree   - Examine per Penn-Tree output separating trees with '`'.
               Only useful with using #obj/attr format.
     /regexp - Use regular expression for wildcard matches.
  
  See Also: look, @decompile, VISUAL, ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP, FLAG LIST,
            ATTRIBUTE FLAGs
  
  
& @protect
  Command: @protect[/<switch>] [<player-name>]
  
  This command 'protects' your current user name from being used by anyone
  else.  Essentially this 'locks in' your name so that if you ever switch
  your name to something else, no one else will be able to use the name
  that you have marked for protection.  You have full access to any name
  you protect.  You can only protect your currently active name.  You may
  delete any name you, yourself, have protected.  Wizards may remove any
  protected name.  Immortals bypass protected names.
  
  Switches available:
    /list    - (default) - list the names you current have protected.  This
               does not take any arguments.
    /add     - Add your current name to your protected name list.  This does
               not take any arguments.
    /del     - Remove the specified name from your protected name list.  This
               requires an argument.
    /alias   - Adds the protected name as an alias.  This will work like 
               @alias with regards to player lookups.
    /unalias - This removes the protected name as an alias.  You can not
               remove the active playername as an alias.
  
  Examples:
    > say name(me)
    You say "Bob"
    > @protect/add
    Your current name has been added to your protect list.
    > @protect/del Bob
    You have successfully deleted 'Bob' from your protect list.
  
  See Also: @name, @alias, listprotection()
  
& @program
  Command: @program <player>=<obj/attr>[:<prefix>]
  
  This command allows for small 'programs' within RhostMUSH. To understand this
  command, you must first understand the fact that it completely bypasses any
  commands, built-in or otherwise, and allows you to send user-input directly
  into your code.
   
  A simple example:
   
  @va me=$start:@prog %#=me/vb:Please enter a word:
  @vb me=@emit You entered %0!;@prog %#=me/vc:Please enter another word:
  @vc me=@emit This time, you entered %0. You're done!
   
  > start
  Please enter a word:
  > foobar       (Note that @program literally gives you a '>' prompt.)
  You entered foobar!
  Please enter another word:
  > hoopla
  This time you entered hoopla. You're done!
{ 'help @program2' for more }
 
& @program2 
  As you can see, this command basically takes what a user types at the
  prompt, stuffs it into %0 in the code in <obj/attr>, and then triggers
  that attribute. Note that when @program triggers an attribute, the enactor
  of that triggered attribute is <player>, and is inserted into %#.
  r-registers are NOT preserved when @program triggers an attribute.  This
  is an unfortunate side-effect from allowing @program to be done across
  reboots and shutdowns.  Keep in mind that this will work differently 
  than MUX's @program by splitting up arguments that were seperated by 
  commas into %0 - %9.  Any argument after the 10th is ignored.  
  Check @list options to see if it is using this method, or the MUX method 
  where it's only %0.
   
  An optional message, <prefix>, may be specified and will be output before
  the @program prompt. This is useful for telling the user what information
  they need to supply.
 
  A player caught in @program may send a command through to the normal
  command processor at the @program prompt by prefixing it with the '|'
  character, for example, '|WHO'.  This may be disabled for that particular
  player with the @toggle NOSHPROG or if globally set this way.  Check
  @list options if shelling commands from within a program is allowed.
 
{ 'help @program3' for more }
  
& @program3
  There are extra things you may do with @program that is not avalable
  anywhere else.  
  
  First, @program can be done across @reboots, @shutdowns, QUIT, LOGOUT,
  or (heaven forbid) server crashes.  It remembers where the program was
  last left off at when the player is next on.
  
  Secondly, there are @toggles in junction with @program.
    1.  NOSHPROG -- specifies the target can not use | to access commands
                    outside the program.
    2.  PROG     -- specifies the target can use a @program on someone else
    3   IMMPROG  -- specifies only an immortal can @quitprogram that player.
  
  Third, you can use pre-defined prompts instead of the default '> ' for
  players.  This is done via the @progprompt command.  
    i.e.  @progprompt *player=This is your prompt>
  
  Note that you need to specify the > at the end if you want it.
  
  See @list options to see what config parameters are enabled for @program
  on the RhostMUSH you're at.
  
  Help files borrowed from TinyMUX 2.0 with permission.
  
  See Also: @toggle, @progprompt, @quitprogram
 
& @quitprogram
  Command: @quitprogram <player>
  
  Terminates the @program for player. If <player> is not specified, then it
  works upon the enactor (a player may quit a program while they are in it
  by piping out @quitprogram, see 'help @program').
  
  Example:
    > @quitprogram *TinyPlayer
    @program cleared.
 
  See also: @program, @progprompt.
 
& @progprompt
  Attribute: @progprompt <player>=<string>
  
  This specifies a string (from 1 to 40 characters) that you may specify 
  for a player going through a program instead of the base '-'.  If you 
  specify a 'NULL' as the string, there will be no prompt.  
  
  The @progprompt does not end the string with a >.  If you wish to have
  one, you'll have to add it to the end of the defined prompt.
  
  See Also: @program, @quitprogram
& @fsay
  Command: @fsay <object> = <message>
  Forces <object> (which may be a player) to say <message>.  Can only
  be executed if the enactor controls the object.
  
  See Also: say, @femit, pose
  
& @SELFBOOT
  Command: @selfboot[/<switch>] [<port>]
 
  This command will disconnect all ports except the port that you
  initiate the command from. (IE: it will disconnect your hung logins)
  
  You may specify the following optional switches:
     /list -- Will list what ports you're currently connected on.
     /port -- When specified with the <port> will boot the specific
              connection.
  
  If you have a single connection, it will not boot it.
  
  Note: @selfboot by itself will boot every connection that has a greater
        idle time than the other connection.  Which, if you have two ACTIVE
        connections may not be the result you want :)
   
  See Also: port()
 
& grab
  Command: grab <user>
  
  The command will check your permissions over the target's location and
  over your current location.  If you are found to have control over both
  of those locations, and of the user itself, then the targeted user
  will be brought to your location.
  
  See Also: join, @teleport  
  
& join
  Command: join <user>
  
  The command will check your permissions over the target's location and
  over your current location.  If you are found to have control over both
  of those location, then you are brought to the targeted user's location.
  
  See Also: grab, @teleport
  
& get
  Command: get[/<switch>] <object>
           get[/<switch>] <exit>
           get[/<switch>] <object>'s <sub-object>
  
  The first form picks up <object> from your location and adds it to your
  inventory.  It will fail if the object is locked against you, or if you
  are inside a player or object that you don't control and which isn't
  set ENTER_OK.
 
  The second form takes an exit from your location and adds it to you.
  Anyone inside you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's destination.
  You may take exits that you own, and exits owned by others in locations that
  you own.
 
  The third form takes <sub-object> from <object> and adds it to your
  inventory.  <object> must be ENTER_OK and <sub-object> must not be locked
  against you for this to work.  The lock on <object> is not checked.
  
{ 'help get2' for more }
  
& get2
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc or @ofail/@afail attributes
                on the target object.  This switch only works if you control
                the object.
 
  <object> and <sub-object> may be either players or things.
  'take' is the same as 'get'.
  
  See Also: drop, @afail, @asucc, @fail, @ofail, @osucc, @succ, ENTER_OK,
            FAILURE, SUCCESS
  
& give
  Command: give <player>=<amount/object>
  Gives player the specified amount of money or <object>. You can't give
  someone money if their new total would be greater than 10000 (No reason to
  get greedy).  You may also give players objects, but the other player must
  be set ENTER_OK to receive something you give. 
  
  See Also: @apay, @cost, @opay, @pay, ENTER_OK
  
& goto
  Command: goto[/<switch>] <direction>
           goto[/<switch>] home
           <direction>
           home
 
  Moves you in the specified direction, assuming that the direction is not
  locked against you.  'move home' is a special command that returns you to
  your home. The word 'move' may be omitted.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc/@odrop/@adrop or @ofail/@afail
                attributes on the exit being used.  This switch only works if
                you control the exit.
 
  'move' is the same as 'goto'.
  
  See Also: enter, home, leave, move()
  
& inventory
  Command: inventory
  Lists what you are carrying and how much money you have.  If alternate 
  inventories are in effect, anything wielded or worn may not be shown up
  by this inventory.  To see these inventories, use the 'wielded' and
  'worn' commands respectively.
  
  See Also: score, worn, wielded
  
& train
  Command: train
  The train command is used to output to the player what exactly you have 
  typed.  The output is not parsed and is taken verbatum and displayed as
  is. 
  
  Example:
    > train @emit To do addition, type:  say add(1,1) = 2
    YourName types -=> @emit To do addition, type: say add(1,1) = 2
    To do addition, type: say add(1,1) = 2                         
  
  See Also: @emit, pose, @pemit, think, ]
  
& worn
  Command: worn
  If alternate inventories are enabled, this command will show you what is
  currently being 'worn' by yourself.  Things 'worn' are identified by having
  a special wizard @toggle 'WORN' set on them.
  
  See Also: inventory, wielded
  
& wielded
  Command: wielded
  If alternate inventories are enabled, this command will show you what is
  currently being 'wielded' by yourself.  Things 'wielded' are identified by
  having a special wizard @toggle 'WIELDED' set on them.
  
  See Also: inventory, worn
  
& kill
  Command: kill <player> [=<cost>]
  Attempts to kill the specified player. Killing costs <cost> coins, which
  gives you a <cost>% chance of killing the player. Thus, spending 100 
  coins always works (except against wizards and immortals, who can never be
  killed). Players cannot be killed in rooms which have been set HAVEN or
  which they control.  If you don't specify a cost, the default is 10 (for a
  10% chance of success).  The player, if killed, receives <cost>/2 coins in
  insurance.
  
  See Also: @akill, @kill, @okill, BEING KILLED, IMMORTAL, ROYALTY
  
& leave
  Command: leave[/<switch>]
  This command leave allows you to exit an object you have entered, arriving
  in the same location as the object. You may not leave an object if you fail
  that object's LeaveLock (but you may still @teleport out, use an exit inside
  the object, or go home).
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @oleave/@aleave or @olfail/@alfail
                attributes on the entered object, and don't perform the
                @oxenter attribute on your new location.  This switch
                only works if you control your current location.
 
  See Also: enter, @lock, ENTER_OK, @aleave, @alfail, @leave, @lfail, @oleave,
            @olfail, @oxenter
  
& IDLE
  Command: idle                 (everyone)
           idle @@<string>      (everyone)
           idle <command>	(wizards only)
  
  This command does nothing.  It will issue a NO-OP (non-operation) which 
  allows the user to send information to the mush without actually unidling.
  While using this command your idle state does not change so to other users
  you will appear to be idle.  
  
  If you specify @@<string> then <string> will be displayed to you as if 
  you issued 'think <string>' but without updating your idle time.  
  
  Note:  The <string> is NOT evaluated, intentionally.
  
  This command can only be used if you're connected to the mush.  It can not
  be used if the command has been restricted from you.
  
  Wizards may specify a command to issue under an 'idle state' as an option.
  
  Examples:
    > idle
    > idle @@boo![add(1,1)]
      boo![add(1,1)]
    > idle think Test: [add(1,1)]    (as a wizard)
      Test: 2
  
  See Also: @@

& INFO
  Command: INFO
  This command gives information about the mush both on-line and on the 
  connect screen.  This is to help automations in gathering information about
  the mush like players connected, uptime, version, and so forth.
  
& LOGOUT
  Command: LOGOUT
  Disconnects you from your character without breaking the network connection
  to the game.  You may then log in to another character.  The LOGOUT command
  must be entered in all capitals.
  
  See Also: QUIT
  
& look
  Command: look[/<switches>] [<object>]
  Displays the description of <object>, or the room you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use look to look at objects held by other
  people, just use 'look <person>'s <object>'.
 
  You may use the /outside switch to look at the location of your current
  location (useful if you are inside a vehicle or other object).  You may
  also look at other objects in the 'outer' location, but you may not
  use the possessive form with the /outside switch (IE: "look/outside
  <person>'s <object>" won't work).
  
  'read' is the same as 'look'.
 
  See Also: @adesc, @describe, @odesc, examine, smell, touch, taste, listen
  
& smell
  Command: smell [<object>]
  Displays the smells of <object>, or the location you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use smell to smell objects held by other
  people.  Just use 'smell <person>'s <object>'.
  
  See Also: look, touch, taste, listen, @ssmell, @sasmell, @sosmell
  
& taste
  Command: taste [<object>]
  Displays the tastes of <object>, or the location you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use taste to taste objects held by other
  people.  Just use 'taste <person>'s <object>'.
  
  See Also: look, smell, touch, listen, @staste, @sataste, @sotaste
  
& think
  Command: think[/<swiches>] <string>
  Returns the string to the enactor at the permission level of the enactor.
  This works just as @pemit me=<string> would work.
  
  The following switches are available:
     /noansi   - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
                 useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
    
  See Also: @pemit, @emit, say, pose
 
& touch
  Command: touch [<object>]
  Displays the contours of <object>, or the location you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use touch to feel objects held by other
  people.  Just use 'touch <person>'s <object>'.
  
  See Also: look, smell, taste, listen, @stouch, @satouch, @sotouch
  
& listen
  Command: listen [<object>]
  Displays the sounds of <object>, or the location you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use listen to hear objects held by other
  people.  Just use 'listen <person>'s <object>'.
  
  This command is not to be confused with @listen.
  
  See Also: look, smell, touch, taste, @slisten, @salisten, @solisten
  
& move
  Command: move[/<switch>] <direction>
           move[/<switch>] home
           <direction>
           home
 
  Moves you in the specified direction, assuming that the direction is not
  locked against you.  'move home' is a special command that returns you to
  your home. The word 'move' may be omitted.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc/@odrop/@adrop or @ofail/@afail
                attributes on the exit being used.  This switch only works if
                you control the exit.
 
  'goto' is the same as 'move'.
  
  See Also: enter, home, leave, move()
  
& MOVE()
  Function: move(<target>, <direction>)
  
  This function works like the move command.  It will 'push' the target through
  the direction specified.  Direction is anything that the original 'move'
  command allows.  If target is invalid, doesn't exist, or you have no control
  over it, it returns a permission denied.  The SIDEFX flag is required to use
  this function.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
   
  Example:
    say move(me,home)
    There's no place like home...
    There's no place like home...
    There's no place like home...

  Individual help is available on each of these sub commands by typing in:
  help news <switch>.  Example: help news yank
  
& news groupinfo
  Command: news/groupinfo <group>
   
  The groupinfo command provides many details and statistics about the
  specified group. This command is restricted to the group administrator
  and Royalty.
  
  Example:  
    > news/groupinfo general
    (You see a bunch of information on the news group general)
  
  See Also: news subscribe, news userinfo
  
& news yank
  Command: news/yank <group>/<seq>
  
  The yank command allows you to delete an article that you've posted to
  a group. You may wish to do this if you feel that you have said something
  that was better left unsaid or you just completely fubared the text of the
  message. There are some restrictions to this command however: you must
  still pass the postlock of the group, no other articles have been posted
  to the group, and your posting is less than 30 minutes old. These
  restrictions are designed to prevent you from posting something that 
  provokes a response from other users and then later deleting your posting,
  making the other user seem foolish to later readers.
  
  Example:
    > news/yank general/0
    (You see) News: Article 0 yanked from group 'general'
  
  See Also: news repost, news postlist
  
& news userinfo
  Command: news/userinfo
  
  The userinfo command will list the information that is stored about you
  in the news database. This includes the total number of postings you have
  made, the total number of active postings that exist, and the number
  of group subscriptions you have.
  
  Example:
    > news/userinfo
    (You see various information you have concerning the news system)
  
  See Also: news postlist, news subscribe
  
& news unsubscribe
  Command: news/unsubscribe <group>
           news/unsubscribe <player>=<group>
  
  The unsubscribe command has two forms. The first form will remove you 
  from a group. In order for this command to succeed you must be subscribed 
  to the named group. By unsubscribing to a group, you loose your marker 
  within the group. If you should resubscribe, you'll need to use the 
  news/jump command to reposition yourself past the articles that you have 
  already read.  The second version of the command allows the group admin 
  or Royalty to unsubscribe a player from a group.
  
  Example:
    > news/unsubscribe general
    (You see) News: You are now unsubscribed from group 'general'.
  
  See Also: news subscribe, news jump
  
& news subscribe
  Command: news/subscribe 
           news/subscribe <group>
           news/subscribe <player>=<group>
  
  The subscribe command does one of three things. The first version will list
  all of the groups (and their descriptions) that you are subscribed to.
  The second version will subscribe you to a group. In order for the 
  second version to succeed, you must pass either the postlock or the
  readlock of the group. When you subscribe to a group, your marker within
  the group is set to the first active posting in the group. The third
  version allows the group administrator or Royalty to pull users into 
  a group.
  
  Example:
    > news/subscribe general
    (You see) News: You are now subscribed to group 'general'.
  
  See Also: news unsubscribe, news jump
  
& news verbose
  Command: news/status/verbose
  
  The verbose switch is used in junction with the /status switch to list
  all available posts within a given group.  
  
  Please refer to 'help news status' for a complete syntax listing.
  
  See Also: news status
  
& news status
  Command: news/status
           news/status/verbose
           news/status <group>
           news/status/verbose <group>
  
  The status command lists articles within a group. The first two versions
  of this command operate on your default group. If the verbose switch
  is given all articles in the group are listed, otherwise, only unread
  articles are listed. Information included in the list is unread status,
  sequence number within the group, owner name, article title.
  
  Example:
    > news/status
    (You see the status of all unread messages in your current group)
    > news/status/verbose
    (You see the status of all messages in your current group)
    > news/status general
    (You see the status of all unread messages in group 'general')
    > news/status/verbose general
    (You see the status of all messages in group 'general')
  
  See Also: news read, news check, news jump
  
& news read
  Command: news/read
           news/read <seq>
           news/read <group>
           news/read <group>/<seq>
  
  The read command enables you to read the postings within a group. The first
  two versions of this command operate on the group that you read last (your
  default group). If you do not specify a sequence number, your marker within
  the group is used to read the next unread article within that group. Then
  your marker is updated to point to the article which follows the one that 
  you just read. This enables you to use the news/read command to read though
  your entire default group, and the news/read <group> command to switch your
  default group to another one, after which you can continue to use the
  news/read command to read through that group. If you specify a sequence 
  number, then that article is read but your marker in that group is not
  adjusted. This enables you to look around in a group without messing up
  your current read position.
  
  Example:
    > news/read general
    (You see the next unread news item in general if one exists)
    > news/read 5
    (You see news posting #5 of the current group you're in)
    > news/read info/0
    (You see news posting #0 of the group 'info')
   
  See Also: news check, news status
  
& news readall
  Command: news/readall [<group>]
  
  The readall command will read all unread news.  If a group is specified it
  will read all unread news in that particular group.  This is especially handy
  if you have large output buffers and want to read all the news up front.
  
  See Also: news read
  
& news readlock
  Command: news/readlock <group>=<text>
  
  The readlock command sets the reading lock for the designated group. If the
  text is left off, the read lock is removed from the group. The readlock text
  is evaluated similar to the u() function. An unset readlock automatically
  means that any user will pass the lock. When a player attempts to read 
  a group, the text in the group's readlock is evaluated with
  the player as both the invoker and executor of the text. Therefore, 
  references to 'me' and '%#' and '%!' will all refer to the player attempting
  to read. This is done to ensure that there are no security holes in this
  process for a user to exploit since there is no higher level security
  involved than the user itself.
  
  This command is restricted to the group administrator or Royalty and higher.
  
  Example:
    > news/readlock CitizensOnly=match(get(%#/guild),Citizen)
    (You see) News: Read lock set for group 'citizensonly'.
  
  See Also: news postlock
  
& news repost
  Command: news/repost <group>/<seq>/<new title>=<new text>
  
  The repost command allows you to fix any errors that you may find in your
  posting after the fact. You must be the owner of the specified article.
  There are two further restrictions on this command: you must repost before
  any other postings are made to the same group, and you must repost within
  a half an hour of the original posting time. These last two restrictions
  are to ensure that you do not provoke people into responding to your
  article and then change it after the fact, making them look foolish to
  people who read the group later.
  
  Example:
    > news/repost general/0/Reposting=This is the new text blah blah blah
    (You see) News: Article 0 reposted to group 'general', expires (date)
  
  See Also: news yank, news postlist
  
& news post
  Command: news/post <group>/<title>=<text>
  
  The post command posts and article to a group. You must be subscribed to a 
  group and pass it's postlock before this command will be successful. The
  title is mandatory, as well as the text. 
  
  Example:
    > news/post general/MyPost=This is my posting
    (You see) News: Article (number) posted to group 'general', expires (date)
  
  See Also: news yank, news repost
  
& news postlock
  Command: news/postlock <group>=<text>
  
  The postlock command sets the posting lock for the designated group. If the
  text is left off, the post lock is removed from the group. The postlock text
  is evaluated similar to the u() function. An unset postlock automatically
  means that any player will pass the postlock. When a player attempts to post
  or repost to a group, the text in the group's postlock is evaluated with
  the player as both the invoker and executor of the text. Therefore, 
  references to 'me' and '%#' and '%!' will all refer to the player attempting
  to post. This is done to ensure that there are no security holes in this
  process for a user to exploit since there is no higher level security
  involved than the user itself.
  
  Example:
    > news/postlock CitizensOnly=match(get(%#/guild),Citizen)
    (You see) News: Post lock set for group 'citizensonly'.
  
  This command is restricted to the group administrator or Royalty and higher.
  
  See Also: news readlock, news post, news postlist
  
& news postlist
  Command: news/postlist
  
  The postlist command lists the postings that you have made in any and all
  groups. You do not have to be currently subscribed to a group for your
  postings in that group to show up on this list. Once articles expire
  they no longer show up on this list.
  
  Example:
    > news/postlist
    (You see a listing of articles you posted that are still in circulation)
  
  See Also: news yank, news repost
  
& news login
  Command: news/login
  
  The login command is triggered automatically when you log into a RhostMUSH.
  The effects of this command are two-fold. First, if you have never used
  the news system before, you are added to the 'general' and 'info' groups.
  Second, your subscribed news groups are checked for unread news. Any groups
  that contain unread news are listed. Groups that do not contain unread
  news are not mentioned.  This is automatically triggered when you log in.
  
  Example:
    > news/login
    (You see either nothing, or new postings to groups that you belong to)
  
  See Also: news subscribe, news status
  
& news jump
  Command: news/jump
           news/jump <seq>
           news/jump <group>
           news/jump <group>/<seq>
  
  The jump command repositions your marker within a group. The first two
  forms of the command operate on your default group. The last two operate
  on the specified group. The two versions that do not have a <seq> jump
  you to the end of the group, where the ones with the <seq> jump you
  to the specified sequence within the group.
  
  Example:
    > news/jump general/0
    (You see) News: Jumped to position 0 of group 'info'.
  
  This effectively makes your current position you last read to article 0.
  
  See Also: news read
  
& news groupmem
  Command: news/groupmem <group>
  
  The groupmem command lists all of the users who are subscribed to the
  specified group. You must be subscribed to the group to use this command
  (the group administrator and Royalty bypass this restriction).
  
  Example:
    > news/groupmem general
    (You see a huge amount of spam of everyone who belongs to group general)
  
  See Also: news unsubscribe
  
& news grouplist
  Command: news/grouplist
  
  The grouplist command lists the names and descriptions of all groups
  currently defined in the news system.
  
  Example:
    > news/grouplist
    (You see a list of all groups in the news system with descriptions)
  
  See Also: news status
  
& news extend
  Command: news/extend <group>/<seq>=<num days>
 
  The extend command alters the expiration time stamp on an article. The group
  and sequence number of the article are necessary to identify it. The number
  of days may be positive or negative. You may also specify 'forever' and
  the article will never expire.
  
  This command is restricted to group administrators and Royalty.
  
  Example: 
    > news/extend info/0=5
    (You see) News: Expiration on article 0 of group 'info' now (new date)
    > news/extend info/0=forever
    (You see) News: Extending expiration forever on article 0 of group 'info'
  
  See Also: news post  
  
& news check
  Command: news/check
           news/check/verbose 
  
  The check command goes through your list of subscribed groups, and scans
  them for unread news statistics. Without the verbose switch, this command
  shows only those groups that have unread news. With the verbose switch,
  this command shows all of your subscribed groups whether or not they have
  unread news.
  
  Example:
    > news/check
    (You see a list of unread articles in all subscribed groups)
    > news/check/verbose
    (You see a list of all subscribed groups with or without new articles)
  
  See Also: news status
  
& news general
  Topics: GENERAL
  The 'general' news group is a system created group that is designed to be
  the catch all group. If there isn't a more narrowly focused group that is
  more appropriate for the news, it goes in 'general'. Please try not to
  spam or flame on this group as it can get pretty ugly.
  
  See Also: news unsubscribe, news subscribe, news grouplist
  
& news info
  Topics: INFO
  The 'info' news group is a system created group that is designed for the
  administrators of the mush to disseminate information to the rest of the
  users of the system. The 'info' news group can not be unsubscribed from.
  
  See Also: news subscribe, news unsubscribe, news grouplist
  
& news new user
  Topics: NEW USER
  As a new user of the news system, you will need to use either the news/login
  command or the news/subscribe command to make the system aware that you want
  to participate. The first time that you use one of these commands, 
  you will be subscribed automatically to the 'general' and 'info' groups.
  These are system generated groups, please refer to the help files on
  them.
  
  You will first want to become familiar with the news/read, news/check,
  and news/subscribe commands. For help on any of these topics, refer
  to: help news
  
  See Also: news subscribe, news unsubscribe, news grouplist
  
& news default group
  Topics: DEFAULT GROUP
  The default group for a user is defined as the last group in which they
  read news. Your default group changes whenever you change to a different
  group with the news/read command. This enables you to switch your focus 
  amongst your subscribed groups and use the shorter versions of the commands
  in the news system since it can make assumptions as to the group that you
  are interested in targeting.

& news description
  Topics: DESCRIPTION (1 of 2)
  The hard coded news system allows players to join news groups where they
  may discuss various themed issues. The system is composed of groups,
  users (players), and articles. 
  
  A group has a description, a read lock, a post lock, a set of subscribed
  users, and a set of active articles. Users must pass the read and/or post
  locks of the group to participate in various aspects of the group.
  A group may also be assigned an administrator. The group administrator
  may do several things to the group including subscribing and unsubscribing
  users from the group, setting read and post locks, yank articles, and
  extend article expiration times.
  
  { Type: help news description2 }
  
& news description2
  Topics: DESCRIPTION (2 of 2)
  Users of the system have a list of subscribed groups, as well as links to
  any active postings that they have made. Within each subscribed group,
  the system maintains a marker. This marker denotes the current article
  that the user is on. When the user reads an article in a group, their
  marker for that group is advanced to the next article. Any article that
  has a sequence number below the marker is considered read. The last group
  that the user has read is also recorded, and becomes their 'default' group
  for the purposes of several of the news commands.
  
  Articles in the system belong both to a group and to a user. They also
  expire two weeks after they are posted. The expiration time may be extended
  or reduced or set to never expire. Once an article expires, it is deleted
  from the system and can not be recovered. Articles can be reposted or yanked
  if necessary, however certain criteria must be met (see the help pages).
 
  For further information on how the news system works, please refer to the
  help pages for the topic or command of interest.

& news technical
  Topics: TECHNICAL (for technical geeks)
  The hard coded news system was modeled after a system that was originally
  written in MUSHcode. This system was named MUSHNews and was written by
  Thorin. The new system, also written by Thorin, has added features and 
  has been engineered to take full advantage of the extended capabilities 
  gained by hardcoding a system into the RhostMUSH server itself.
  
  The news system was written in January of 1997, and consists of
  approximately 5000 lines of C code. It utilizes an ndbm database separate
  from the RhostMUSH database to store all of it's information.
  
  System Limits:
    Group name        length   31 [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.]*
    Article title     length   39 
    Article text      length 3999

& news mailto
  Command: news/mailto <group>/<seq #> <addr list>=[<subject>//]<text message>
  
  This will allow you to mail the news posting from a given
  group to one or more players.  The group and sequence # must both be valid,
  and accessable by you. You may specify an optional subject line and a
  text message comment regarding the posting.
  
  The address list follows the same format as that described in

  Type 6&8: ofparse(1,[<eval1> ,<eval2> ... <evalN>], <output seperator>)
  
  This function will take each <eval> and returns it based on the <type>.
  
  The following types exist:
    1  -- Issue a firstof().  Essentially return the first <eval> that is
          a true boolean.  This stops evaluation on first true <eval>.
          The <default> is returned if no evals are met.  The <default>
          is the assumed argument if only passed a single argument.
    2  -- Issue an allof().  Essentially returning every <eval> that is
          a true boolean.  This evaluates every argument.
    3  -- This is the reverse of '1'.  It returns the first <eval> that
          is a false boolean.  IT stops evaluation on first false <eval>.
          This again assumes <default> if no other arguments.
    4  -- This is the reverse of '2'.  It returns every false <eval>
          boolean. This evaluates every argument.
    5  -- Issue a strfirstof().  Essentially returns the first <eval> that
          is a non-null string.  This stops evaluation on first non-null
          <eval>.
    6  -- Issues a strallof().  Essentially returns every <eval> that is
          a non-null string.  This evaluates everyu argument.
    7  -- This is the reverse of '5'.  It essentially will either return
          a null or the default value.
    8  -- This is the reverse of '6'.  It essentially will return
          a list of nulls if you have such in your list.  This evaluates
          every argument.

& OUTPUTPREFIX
  Command: OUTPUTPREFIX <string>
  Causes <string> to be output on a line by itself before printing the
  results of each command.  This command is intended for use by external
  robot programs, and may be restricted to players whose ROBOT flag is set.
  The OUTPUTPREFIX command must be entered in all capitals.
  
  See Also: @robot, OUTPUTSUFFIX, ROBOT
  
& OUTPUTSUFFIX
  Command: OUTPUTSUFFIX <string>
  Causes <string> to be output on a line by itself after printing the results
  of each command.  This command is intended for use by external robot
  programs, and may be restricted to players whose ROBOT flag is set.
  The OUTPUTSUFFIX command must be entered in all capitals.
  
  See Also: @robot, OUTPUTPREFIX, ROBOT
  
& page
  Command: p[age][/<switch>] <player-list> [=[<control>]<message>]
           p[age][/<switch>] ,<comma-delim-player-list> [=[<control>]<message>]
           p[age][/<switch>] <message> (if @toggled MUXPAGE)
           lp[age][/<switch>] <message to last person(s) you paged>
           rp[age][/<switch>] <message to last person who paged you>
           mrp[age][/<switch>] <message to player list in last page to you>
 
  Note: If you are paging people with spaces in their name, start the page
        with a comma.  i.e.  page ,player with space, player2 = message
  
  <control> is the formatter for the page (", ;, :, etc)
  
  This command sends <message> to <player-list>.  If you do not specify a 
  message, it tells a player that you are looking for them, and tell the 
  player where you are.  You may use either the player's name or alias, and 
  you may also give a string that uniquely matches the start of a player's 
  name on the WHO list.  You may specify from one to more players in a page 
  and you can use a comma to delimit the player list instead of a space for
  players that contain spaces in their names.  You can not however, mix 
  commas and spaces.
 
  You can format the message one of several ways by specifying ':', ';', or
  '"' as the first character of the message.  ':' and ';' format the message
  as 'From afar, <player> <message>', with ';' omitting the space between
  <player> and <message>.  '"' formats the message in normal page format
  (this is the default).
  
  Switches available:
    noansi -- show raw ansi (the %c/%x substitutions) instead of colors.
 
{ 'help page2' for more }
  
& page2  
  If your Idle attribute is set to something, then it is sent to anyone
  who successfully pages you.  This is useful for when you are away from
  your terminal for a short while.
  
  You can selectively disable pages from certain players with the '@lock/page'
  command (players must pass the lock in order to page you).  If someone
  cannot page you, they will be sent a message including of your Reject
  attribute if they try.  If someone pages you while you are not connected,
  they are sent a message including your Away attribute.
   
  Everyone you page is stored so that you may repeat the page to the entire
  list using the 'lpage' command.  To respond to someone who just paged you,
  you may use the 'rpage' command.
  
  NOTE:  You may set the MUXPAGE @toggle (@toggle me=muxpage) so that page
         works similiar to how you expect in MUX/TM3.  'lp' will still work
         the same.

& mrpage
  Command: mrpage[/<switch>] [[<control>]<message>]
  
  <control> is the formatter for the page (", ;, :, etc)
  
  This command will automatically page the last person(s) who paged you.
  This will in essence, page the entire list that you saw in the last page
  to you so that you can continue with multi-page messages.
  
  You need not specify a player name.  It accepts and understands all
  the format and commands that page would understand.
  
  Switches available:
    noansi -- show raw ansi (the %c/%x substitutions) instead of colors.
  
  See Also: page, lpage, whisper, say, pose

  Command: rpage[/<switch>] [[<control>]<message>]
  
  <control> is the formatter for the page (", ;, :, etc)
  
  This command will automatically page the last person who paged you.
  You need not specify a player name.  It accepts and understands all
  the format and commands that page would understand.

& lpage
  Command: lpage[/<switch>] [[<control>]<message>]
  
  <control> is the formatter for the page (", ;, :, etc)
  
  This command will automatically page the last person(s) who you paged.
  You need not specify a player name.  It accepts and understands all
  the format and commands that page would understand.
  
  Switches available:
    noansi -- show raw ansi (the %c/%x substitutions) instead of colors.
  
  See Also: page, rpage, mrpage, whisper, say, pose
  
  
& pose
  Command: pose[/<switches>] <message>
  Displays <message> to everyone in your current room, preceded by your name
  and optionally a space.  Example: the command 'pose jumps for joy' produces
  '<yourname> jumps for joy'.
  
  No switches are available for the ':' or ';' shorthands.
   
  The following switches are available:
     /default - (default) Put a space between your name and the message
                (IE, display '<name> <message>').
     /nospace - Don't put a space between your name and the message
                (IE, display '<name><message>').
     /noansi   - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
                 useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
 
  See Also: page, say, whisper, :, ;, "
  
& quit    
  Command: QUIT 
  Logs you out and disconnects you from the game. Must be in all upper case.
  
  See Also: LOGOUT
  
& read
  Command: read [<object>]
  Displays the description of <object>, or the room you're in if you don't
  specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or
  'here' is legal.  You can also use look to look at objects held by other
  people, just use 'read <person>'s <object>'.
 
  You may use the /outside switch to look at the location of your current
  location (useful if you are inside a vehicle or other object).  You may
  also look at other objects in the 'outer' location, but you may not
  use the possessive form with the /outside switch (IE: "read/outside
  <person>'s <object>" won't work).
  
  'look' is the same as 'read'.
  
  See Also: examine, touch, taste, listen, smell
  
& ;
  Command: ;<message>
  This command is much like the ':' command, except that no space is inserted
  between your name and the action.  Example: the command ';'s watch beeps.'
  produces '<yourname>'s watch beeps.'.
 
  Warning: This command does not work in command lists run from an attribute
  because the ';' is treated as the command separator.  Use pose/nospace
  instead.
  
  If you have a space after the ';' it will use the ':' format instead.
 
  See Also: page, pose, say, whisper, :, "
  
& :
  Command: :<message>
  Displays <message> to everyone in your current room, preceded by your name
  and a space.  Example: the command ':jumps for joy' produces
  '<yourname> jumps for joy'.
  
  If you have a space after the ':' it will use the ';' format instead.
  
  See Also: page, pose, say, whisper, ;, "
  
& "
  Command: "<message>
  Says <message> out loud to everyone in your current room.  Example:
  the command '"Where is the movie theater?' produces
  '<yourname> says "Where is the movie theater>"'.  Note that the closing
  double quote is automatically added.
  
  See Also: page, pose, say, :, ", @saystring
  
& #
  Command: #<number> <command>
  Forces the object whose database number is <number> to perform <command>.
  Example: '#1033 move north' forces object #1033 to go north (assuming that
  you control it).  The same restrictions that apply to @force also apply to
  this command.
  
  See Also: @force
  
& \\
  Command: \\<message>
  Outputs <message> to everyone in your current room without embellishment.
  Example: the command '\\A chill falls over the room.' produces
  'A chill falls over the room.'
  
  See Also: @emit, @oemit, NOSPOOF
  
& say
  Command: say[/<switches>] <message>
  Says <message> out loud to everyone in your current room. You can also
  use '"<message>'.  No switches are allowed with the '"' shorthand.
  
  The following switches exist for the say command:
    /noansi    - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
                 useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
  
  See Also: page, pose, whisper, :, ;, ", @saystring
  
& score
  Command: score
  Displays how much money you have.  Helpful to see if any machines are
  looping.
  
  See Also: @ps, LOOPING, inventory
  
& SESSION
  Command: SESSION
  Displays information on how many characters you have sent and received
  during this session, and which (Internal) port you are connected to on the
  mush.  It must be typed in all uppercase.
 
  Example:
   > SESSION
                                   Characters Input----  Characters Output---
  Player Name     On For Idle Cmds Pend  Lost     Total  Pend  Lost     Total
  Mortal           00:06   0s   16    0     0        44   156     0      2679
  2 Players logged in.
 
  Pending characters are those waiting to be acted on as commands (for input)
  or waiting to be sent out over the network (output).  Lost characters are
  due to overflowing either the MUSH's input or output buffers, either as the
  result of running a single command that produces too much output (such as
  @find and @search commands that match a large number of objects), or from
  typing too much on one line.
 
  Note: your Pending count for output will always be nonzero, as the output
  of the SESSION command hasn't been sent out over the network yet.

& take
  Command: take[/<switch>] <object>
           take[/<switch>] <exit>
           take[/<switch>] <object>'s <sub-object>
 
  The first form picks up <object> from your location and adds it to your
  inventory.  It will fail if the object is locked against you, or if you
  are inside a player or object that you don't control and which isn't
  set ENTER_OK.
 
  The second form takes an exit from your location and adds it to you.
  Anyone inside you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's destination.
  You may take exits that you own, and exits owned by others in locations that
  you own.
 
  The third form takes <sub-object> from <object> and adds it to your
  inventory.  <object> must be ENTER_OK and <sub-object> must not be locked
  against you for this to work.  The lock on <object> is not checked.
  
{ 'help take2' for more }
  
& take2
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc or @ofail/@afail attributes
                on the target object.  This switch only works if you control
                the object.
 
  <object> and <sub-object> may be either players or things.
  'get' is the same as 'take'.
  
  See Also: drop, @afail, @asucc, @fail, @ofail, @osucc, @succ, ENTER_OK,
            FAILURE, SUCCESS
  
& throw
  Command: throw[/<switch>] <object>
           throw[/<switch>] <exit>
 
  The first form removes <object> from your inventory and puts it in your
  location, except for the following special cases: Dropping a STICKY thing
  sends it home, and dropping a thing in a room with a drop-to sends the
  thing to the drop-to location.
 
  The second form removes <exit> from your list of exits and adds it to the
  list of exits for the current location.  Anyone in the same location as
  you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's destination.  You can
  only drop exits when you own the location where you are dropping them.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @odrop/@adrop attributes on the dropped
                 object.  This switch only works if you control the object.
 
  'drop' is the same as 'throw'.
  
  See Also: get, @adrop, @drop, @odrop, DROP-TO, STICKY
  
& use
  Command: use <object>
  Uses <object>.  Some objects will do interesting, useful, or dangerous
  things when used, for instance, using a camera should result in a 
  picture being taken.
  
  See Also: @ause, @ouse, @use
  
& version
  Command: version
  Displays the version of MUSH that is running and the date it was last
  rebuilt.
  
  See Also: +uptime
  
& whisper
  Command: whisper <player>=<message>
  Whispers the message to the named person, if they are in the same room as
  you. No one else can see the message that you whisper.
 
  You can format the message one of several ways by specifying ':', ';', or
  '"' as the first character of the message.  ':' and ';' format the message
  as 'You sense <player> <message>', with ';' omitting the space between
  <player> and <message>.  '"' formats the message in normal whisper format
  (this is the default).
  
  See Also: page, pose, say, :, ;, "
  
& doing
  Command: DOING <prefix>
  Displays a list of players currently connected to the MUSH.
  The DOING report tells you how long a player has been on, how long they
  have been inactive, and what they are doing (if they have used the @doing
  command).  If <prefix> is specified, only players whose names start with
  <prefix> are listed.  There are two forms of the DOING listing.  One
  shows GUILDS (an arbitrary attribute called 'guild' on a player) and
  the other has just the basic information.  The GUILD field in the DOING
  can be optionally changed to another field.  If you see another field than
  'Guilds' the default value has been changed.
  
  Also, if enabled, you may see either a '*' or the actual bit of the staff
  when you do a DOING.
  
  Note:  DOING must be in all caps to work.
   
  See Also: @doing, WHO
  
& who
  Command: WHO <prefix>
  Displays a list of players currently connected to the MUSH.
  The WHO report tells you how long a player has been on, how long they
  have been inactive, and what they are doing (if they have used the @doing
  command).  If <prefix> is specified, only players whose names start with
  <prefix> are listed.  There are two forms of the WHO listing.  One
  shows GUILDS (an arbitrary attribute called 'guild' on a player) and
  the other has just the basic information.  The GUILD field in the DOING
  can be optionally changed to another field.  If you see another field than
  'Guilds' the default value has been changed.
  
  Also, if enabled, you may see either a '*' or the actual bit of the staff
  when you do a WHO.
  
  Note:  WHO must be in all caps to work.
  
  See Also: @doing, DOING
  
& wanderer
  Reference: wanderer
  
  The wanderer is what shows up on the default WHO/DOING listing for the mush.
  This is in effect a reference to show you are new to the mush and have been
  on for only a short bit.  However, depending on the guidelines of the mush
  you are on, this meaning can be changed arbitrarily.  Also, the value of
  'Wanderer' in the 'Guild' field in the WHO/DOING can be changed to something
  else as well depending on the configuration on that particular RhostMUSH.
  
& ]
  Command: ]<command>
  
  This tells the parser that the command following it is to not be parsed.
  
  See Also: train

& >
  Command: ><attribute> <object in cluster>[=<value>]
  Synonym: @cluster/set <object> = <attribute>:[<value>]
   
  Sets the attribute named <attribute> on <object> to <value>.  If
  <attribute> is not a predefined attribute (like ofail or va), then it is
  created.  Attributes so created are called user-named attributes.
  Attribute names may only contain letters, numbers, and the characters
  < -_.@#$^&*~?=+| >, and must start with a letter.  The names of user-named
  attributes may not be abbreviated (an attempt to get the value of the
  attribute will fail, and an attempt to set will create a new attribute).
  
  The object that is chosen will be either the object in the cluster that
  already contains the attribute, or the object in the cluster with the
  least number of attributes currently on it.
  
  Specifying an object not in the cluster will return an error.
  
  Attributes must start with an alpha character, or in special cases any
  of the following characters: ~_#.+
  
  Example:
    >myattr ClusterObj=This is my data on attribute 'myattr'
    Set.
   
  See Also: @set, @cluster set, VATOVZ, ZATOZZ, &

& &
  Command: &<attribute> <object>[=<value>]
           &`<tree-attribute> <object>[=<value>]
  Synonym: @set <object> = <attribute>:[<value>]
   
  Sets the attribute named <attribute> on <object> to <value>.  If
  <attribute> is not a predefined attribute (like ofail or va), then it is
  created.  Attributes so created are called user-named attributes.
  Attribute names may only contain letters, numbers, and the characters
  < -_.@#$^&*~?=+| >, and must start with a letter.  The names of user-named
  attributes may not be abbreviated (an attempt to get the value of the
  attribute will fail, and an attempt to set will create a new attribute).
  The & command may be used to set predefined attributes (in this instance,
  '&<attr> <object>=<value>' is equivalent to '@<attr> <object>=<value>').
  
  Attributes must start with an alpha character, or in special cases any
  of the following characters: ~_#.+
  
  Starting with a '`' will tell it to use the TREE method for setting 
  attributes which will attempt to set/validate all branches to the tree
  prior to setting it.
  
  Example:
    &myattr Object=This is my data on attribute 'myattr'
    Set.
   
  See Also: @set, @cluster set, VATOVZ, ZATOZZ, >, ATTRIBUTE TREES
  
& @@
  Command: @@ <args>
 
  This command does nothing, therefore it is useful for putting comments into
  a MUSH program.  Be careful that ()'s and {}'s in the (otherwise ignored)
  arguments are nested correctly, lest your command-ending ; be trapped
  inside.
 
  Example:
     @va me=$foobar *:@fo #1234=%0;@@ This controls my foobar puppet.
  
  See Also: @break, @assert, idle
  
& @assert
  Command: @assert <value> [=<command(s)>]
  
  The @assert command is used to optionally break out of any processing of
  commands.  The possible values to pass to it are zero (0) or non-zero
  (which is any number but zero (0)...).  If a non-zero is passed to this 
  command, then it treats it as a NOOP and continues processing as if nothing 
  occurred.  However, if a zero number is passed to this command.  The 
  processing of the command stops there and no further processing is done.
  
  Available Switches:
    /queued -- process the <commands(s)> by queuing them (default).
    /inline -- process the <commands(s)> inline and do not queue them.
  
  This works opposite of @break.
  
  Example:
    > @create obj
    > @set obj=!halt inherit
    > @va obj=$test *:@pemit %#=Before assert;@assert %0;@pemit %#=After assert
    > test 1
      Before assert
      After assert
    > test 0
      Before assert
  
  See Also: $-COMMAND, @@, @break, @skip

& @break
  Command: @break[/switch] <value> [=<command(s)>]
  
  The @break command is used to optionally break out of any processing of
  commands.  The possible values to pass to it are zero (0) or non-zero
  (which is any number but zero (0)...).  If a zero is passed to this command,
  then it treats it as a NOOP and continues processing as if nothing occurred.
  However, if a non-zero number is passed to this command.  The processing
  of the command stops there and no further processing is done.
  
  Available Switches:
    /queued -- process the <commands(s)> by queuing them (default).
    /inline -- process the <commands(s)> inline and do not queue them.
  
  Example:
    > @create obj
    > @set obj=!halt inherit
    > @va obj=$testme *:@pemit %#=Before break;@break %0;@pemit %#=After break
    > testme 0
      Before break
      After break
    > testme 1
      Before break
  
  See Also: $-COMMAND, @@, @assert, @skip
  
& @chown
  Command: @chown <object>[=<player>]
           @chown <object>/<attr>[=<player>]
  The first form changes the ownership of <object> to <player> (default is
  to yourself).  Objects may be things, rooms or exits. To chown things, you
  have to be carrying the thing. For rooms or exits, you have to be in the
  room. Objects must have the CHOWN_OK flag set before they may be @chowned.
  In a room, the command used must be @chown here = <name>, and for an object,
  you must be very specific.
 
  The second form changes the ownership of the indicated attribute on <object>
  to <player> (default is the owner of the object).  You may only @chown
  unlocked attributes.  You may @chown unlocked attributes on objects that
  you own to yourself, and you may also @chown attributes that you own on
  objects owned by others to the owner of the object.
 
  When an object is @chowned, all unlocked attributes on the object are
  automatically @chowned as well, locked attributes remain owned by their
  original owners.
 
  The HALTED flag is automatically set on the new copy of the object.
  Players can't be @chowned; they always own themselves. 
  
  See Also: @lock, @Unlock, CHOWN_OK, ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP
  
& @clone
  Command: @clone[/<switches>] <object>[=<newname/cost>]
 
  Creates an exact duplicate of <object> that is owned by you and (for things
  and exits) puts it in your current location.  You may have the object put
  in your inventory (or your exitlist in the case of cloning exits) by using
  the /inventory switch.
 
  You may clone your own objects, plus VISUAL objects owned by others.
  The INHERIT and ROYALTY bits of the (new) object are cleared when the object
  is cloned.  If <newname> is specified, it is used as the name instead of
  the original name.
 
  If you clone a linked exit, an attempt is made to link the clone to the
  same location.  Except when using the /inventory switch, you can only clone
  exits when you own your current location.
 
  If you clone a room with a drop-to, an attempt is made to link the drop-to
  to the same location.
 
  If the original object was owned by you, then the ACLONE attribute is run
  in the new attribute, otherwise the new object is set HALTED.  Exits and
  contents of cloned objects are not cloned.
  
{ 'help @clone2' for more }
  
& @clone2
  The following switches are available:
     /cost       - Treat the argument after the = as the cost of the new
                   object, not the name.
     /inherit    - Don't reset the INHERIT bit on the new object.
     /inventory  - Create the new object in your inventory (or your exitlist,
                   in the case of cloning exits).
     /location   - Create the new object in your location (default).
     /parent     - Set the new object's parent to be the template object and
                   don't copy the attributes.
  
  See Also: @create, @decompile, @destroy, VISUAL
  
& @cluster
  Command: @cluster[/<switch>] [[<arguments>][=<values>]]
  
  The @cluster command is used to 'cluster' or link together a set of 2 or
  more dbref#'s into a single entity to be used and accessed by a set of
  clustering commands and functions as the aforementioned single entity.
  This is used to allow more flexability of data storage, better organization
  and a way to allow better data handling of the database as a whole.
  
  For more help on what @cluster can do, please refer to the following
  switches available.  Individidual help is available with 
  'help @cluster <switch>'

    /wipe   - Wipe attrib(s) in cluster
   
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster wipe
  Command: @cluster/wipe <object>[/<wildattr>]
           @cluster/wipe/regexp <object>[/<wildattr>]
  
  The wipe switch, with an optional regexp switch addon, will wipe all matching
  attributes from every item in the cluster.  This works exactly like @wipe
  except is performed on the entirity of the cluster.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/wipe #1234/va*
    Cluster wipe: 24 total objects, 0 no-match, 0 safe, 4 attributes wiped.
    > @cluster/wipe/regexp #1234/^..$
    Cluster wipe: 24 total objects, 0 no-match, 0 safe, 22 attributes wiped.

& @cluster new
  Command: @cluster/new <object>
  
  The new switch, takes the specified object and assigns it as a cluster 
  object.  Once defined as a cluster, new objects may be /added to the cluster
  or /deleted to the cluster.  A cluster should never become corrupted, but if
  there is some inconsistancy, you may /repair it without worry of data loss.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/new existing-cluster
    That object is already a cluster.
    > @cluster/new myobject
    Cluster for object #123 has been created.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster add
  Command: @cluster/add <cluster>=<new object>
  
  The add switch adds new objects to a pre-existing cluster.  The /add only 
  works on objects that do not currently belong to a cluster.  You can have
  upwards to 600 or more objects in a single cluster at this time.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/add notacluster=myobject
    That object isn't a cluster.  Use @cluster/new to make one.
    > @cluster/add mycluster=myobject
    Cluster object #123 has been added to #789
   
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster del
  Command: @cluster/del <cluster object>
  
  The del switch removes an item from a cluster.  This only removes the 
  cluster attributes and configuration from the object, not the actual data
  on the object itself.  It may be re-added into the cluster at a later time
  and without any worry of loss of data.  If this is the only object in the
  cluster, then the cluster is identified as being removed in its entirety.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/del notacluster
    That object isn't a cluster.  Use @cluster/new to make one.
    > @cluster/del myclusterobject
    Cluster object #123 has been deleted.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster clear
  Command: @cluster/clear <cluster object>
  
  The clear switch removes clustering information from all objects in the
  cluster, essentially 'clearing' the cluster in its entirety.  This only 
  removes the cluster related information and does not delete any attributes
  or information on the cluster members themselves.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/clear notacluster
    That object isn't a cluster.  Use @cluster/new to make one.
    > @cluster/clear myclusterobject
    Cluster removed with member #123.  A total of 1 objects de-clustered.
  
  Note: the total number of objects cleared in the cluster will be shown.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster list
  Command: @cluster/list <cluster object>
  
  The list switch lists the various parameters for the cluster specified.
  Options shown are total members in cluster, the threshold, threshold
  action, total attributes and attribute statistics.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/list #3683
    Showing cluster statistics for cluster with member #3683.
    3 total members: #3683 #3672 #3667
    969 total attributes  [Highest: 324,  Lowest: 322,  Average: 323].
    Threshold has not been set.
    Threshold action has not been set.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster threshhold
  Command: @cluster/threshhold <cluster object>=<value>
  
  The threshhold switch sets the threshhold value that will let the
  cluster know when the threshhold action is to be executed.  The
  threshhold is defined as the LOWEST attribute count on any item
  currently in the cluster.  To avoid recursion based attacks, the
  threshold is only triggered once every 10 seconds regardless of
  the threshhold being reached or not.
   
  Example:
    > @cluster/threshhold #3683=500
    Cluster threshold for cluster #3683 set to: 500 
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster func
& @cluster action func
& @cluster func action
& @cluster action
  Command: @cluster/action <cluster object>=<string>
           @cluster/action/func <cluster object>=<string>
  
  The action switch sets the action that will be executed on the cluster
  once the threshhold value has been reached.  The threshhold value
  is defined as the LOWEST attribute count on any item currently in
  the cluster.  The action is only executed once every 10 seconds to
  avoid recursive based attacks.
  
  The /func switch will set the FUNCTION action instead of normal action.
  The function action has precedence over the normal action.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/action #3683=@pemit [owner(me)]=Triggered!
    Cluster action for cluster #3683 set to: @pemit [owner(me)]=Triggered!
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster edit
  Command: @cluster/edit <cluster object>/<wild-attr> = <search>,<replace>
           @cluster/edit <cluster object>/<wild-attr> = ^,<text>
           @cluster/edit <cluster object>/<wild-attr> = $,<text>
  
  This works like @edit except for the entire cluster.  It essentially edits
  all matching instances of every wild-attr on the cluster.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/edit #3683/test36??=boo,foo
    Cluster editing: (multiple)
    ====[Edit]---> #3683
    Set - TEST3611: foo
    Set - TEST3614: foo
    ====[Edit]---> #3672
    Set - TEST3610: foo
    Set - TEST3613: foo
    Set - TEST3616: foo
    ====[Edit]---> #3667
    Set - TEST3612: foo
    Set - TEST3615: foo
    Cluster editing complete.
    
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster set
  Command: @cluster/set <cluster object>=[!]<flag> [[!]<flag> [!]<flag> ...]
           @cluster/set <cluster object>=<attribute>:<value>
           @cluster/set <cluster object>=<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>
           @cluster/set <cluster object>/<attr>=[!]<attrflag>
  Synonym: ><attribute> <object in cluster>[=<value>]
  
  This works like @set except with the entire cluster.  It automatically 
  identifies what object in the cluster contains the attribute and modifies
  that attribute, otherwise, it will smartly pick an object in the cluster
  for the new attribute.  If setting flags, it applies the flags to every
  item in the cluster.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/set #3683=inherit
    Cluster: Flags (inherit) set on cluster members #3683 #3672 #3667.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster repair
  Command: @cluster/repair <cluster object>
  
  The repair switch will attempt to repair any damaged cluster by resetting
  the cluster specific values on the cluster.  Corruption shouldn't happen
  but outside influences (like running out of disk quota) could cause some
  unexpected situations.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/repair #3683 
    Step #1: Walking object cluster membership.
    Step #2: Sanitizing membership lists.
    Step #3: Sanitizing thresholds and action lists.
    Cluster list is error free.  Nothing to repair.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster grep
  Command: @cluster/grep <cluster object>=<attribute(s)>,<string>
           @cluster/grep/regexp <cluster object>=<attribute(s)>,<string>
  
  This works like @grep but is intended for the entirety of the cluster.
  This essentially searches for any match (partial or wildcarded) on 
  any attribute on the cluster.
  
  You may specify the optional regexp switch to use regular expression 
  matching instead of the default matching.
  
  Example: 
    > @cluster/grep #3683=*,*foo*
    Cluster grep: (multiple)
    ====[Grep]---> #3683
    TEST3611 TEST3614
    ====[Grep]---> #3672
    TEST3610 TEST3613 TEST3616
    ====[Grep]---> #3667
    TEST3612 TEST3615
    Cluster grep completed.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster reaction
  Command: @cluster/reaction <cluster object>=<old string>,<new string>
  
  The reaction switch allows you to edit the existing action attribute.
  The action attribute for the cluster is an internal attribute and
  requires this special switch to edit it.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/reaction #3683=Triggered,Woot
    Cluster ActionList: @pemit [owner(me)]=Woot!
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster cut
  Command: @cluster/cut <cluster object>
  
  The cut switch should only be used as an absolute last measure.  This
  effectively forces the removal of the target item from the cluster in
  its entirety.  Once you cut an object from the cluster, you should 
  always use the repair switch on the remaining items in the cluster.
  This does NOT do any sanitizing checks.
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/cut #3683 
    Dbref #3683 has been forcefully declustered.
    It is strongly recommended that you @cluster/repair the remaining items 
             in the cluster.
  
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @cluster trigger
  Command: @cluster/trigger <cluster object>/<attr> [=<param> [, <param>]... ]
  
  This switch works exactly like the normal @trigger command except it scans
  the entirety of the cluster for the matching attribute.  This essentially 
  triggers actions on the matching attribute and allows passing arguments 
  (params) to the attribute as arguments %0 to %9 (just like @trigger).
  
  Example:
    > @cluster/set #3683=xxx:@emit Whee - %%0  (remember, @cluster/set  evals)
    Set.
    > @cluster/trigger #3683/xxx=abcd  
    Whee - abcd
   
  See Also:  clusters, cluster functions, cluster commands, >

& @create
  Command: @create <name> [=<cost>]
  Creates a thing with the specified name.  Creation costs either <cost>
  or 10 coins, whichever is greater. The value of a thing is proportional
  to its cost, specifically, value=(cost/5)-1.  The value may not be greater
  than 100, values that would be greater than 100 are rounded down to 100.
  
  See Also: @destroy, TYPES OF OBJECTS
  
& @decompile
  Command: @decompile[/<switch>] <thing>[/<wild-attrib>] [=<newname>]
           @decompile/tf[/<switch>] <thing>[/wild-attrib>] [=<new prefix>]
  
  Dumps the sequence of commands you would have to type to clone <thing>.
  This is handy for saving your objects in a text file in case the MUSH dies
  a horrible death, or for moving your pride-and-joy creation from one MUSH
  to another.  @decompile works on all object types.
  If you specify <newname>, then the commands emitted will set attributes,
  locks, and flags on an object named <newname> and will omit the command
  to create the object.  You may also specify an optional wild-carded
  attribute.  The following switches exist:
      /all     - Show everything (this is the default)
      /attrib  - Show just attributes
      /flags   - Show just flags
      /regexp  - use regular expression matching
      /tree    - Examine based on Penn trees using '`' as a separator.
      /tf      - allows prefix formatting for clients.
  
  Example: @decompile MyObject/attr*
           @decompile MyObject
           @decompile MyObject/attr*=NewName
           @decompile MyObject=Newname
  
  Note:  The /tf switch changes the syntax slightly.
         1. When in use, the /tf switch changes what is normally <newname> 
            after the '=' into a new prefix for formatting.
         2. When in use, the /tf switch will ALWAYS display the dbref# of the
            target object.  There is no way to override this value when using
            the /tf switch.
         3. If the TFPREFIX attribute exists on the ENACTOR of the @decompile,
            it will use that value (unevaluated) instead of the default.
         4. The default prefix for the /tf switch is: 'FugueEdit > '

& @destroy
  Command: @destroy[/<switches>] <object>
  This command destroys <object> and refunds its cost of creation to its
  owner.  You must own <object> in order to @destroy it, unless its
  DESTROY_OK flag is set, in which case anyone holding it may @destroy it.
  Rooms, exits, and objects may be destroyed, although the actual
  destruction of rooms is delayed for up to ten minutes and the BYEROOM flag
  is set on the victim room.  Clearing the BYEROOM flag on the room spares it
  from destruction.
 
  The @destroy command will not destroy objects with the SAFE flag set unless
  the /override switch is specified.  The DESTROY_OK flag overrides the
  protection given by the SAFE flag.
 
  The following switches are available:
    /override  - Negate protection offered by the SAFE flag.
    /instant   - For compatibility only.  This switch does nothing else.
  
  Do note, you can NOT destroy anything set INDESTRUCTIBLE.
  
  See Also: DESTROY_OK, SAFE, BYEROOM
  
& @dig
  Command: @dig[/<switches>] <name> [= <exitlist> [, <exitlist>] ]
  Creates a new room with the specified name and displays its number. This 
  command costs 10 coins. If the [= <exitlist>] option is used, an exit will
  be opened from the current room to the new room automatically.  If the
  second <exitlist> option (after the comma) is specified, an exit from the
  new room back to the current room with the specified [Exits] name is
  opened.  Either exit creation may fail if you do not have sufficient
  rights to the current room to open or link the new exit.
  Example: The command
 
     @dig Kitchen = Kitchen;k;north;n,south;s
 
  will dig a room called Kitchen, and open an exit called 'Kitchen' in your
  current room.  The ; symbol means that you may enter the exit by typing
  'k', 'north' or 'n' also.  This command also opens the exit 'south;s' from
  'Kitchen' back to where you are.  Only the first Exit name is displayed in
  the Obvious exits list.
 
  If you specify the /teleport switch, then you are @teleported to the
  room after it is created and any exits are opened.
 
  See Also: @destroy, @link, @open, LINKING, TYPES OF OBJECTS
  
& @doing
  Command: @doing[/<switches>] [<message>]
  Sets your doing message, which appears after your name in the WHO report.
  The following switches are available:
     /message - Sets your Doing string in the WHO report. (default)
     /poll    - Displays the current Doing poll from the WHO report.
     /unique  - Sets your doing in your ACTIVE window only.
  
  See Also: WHO, DOING
  
& @mailsig
  Command: @mailsig <targetplayer>=<string>
  
  mail signatures are done by storing a user-def attribute on your character.
  the attribute is called 'MAILSIG'.  To set this attribute, you would do:
  
  Examples:
    @mailsig me=This is my signature.
    &mailsig me=This is my signature.
    @set me=mailsig:This is my signature.
  
  Please keep in mind that this attribute is *NOT* evaluated for functions and
  is taken as-is.
  
  See Also: mail, folder, MAILFILTER
  
& @dolist
  Command: @dolist[/<switch>] [<delimiter>|<pid>] <list>=<action>
  
  <list> is a list of strings, which can be object numbers, attributes, or
  arbitrary words.  <action> is a command to perform once for each item in
  <list>, replacing the special symbol ## with the corresponding item from
  <list>. By default, @dolist considers each item in <list> to be separated
  with spaces. If you specify the /delimit switch, then each item is
  considered to be separated by <delimiter>. <delimiter> must be a single
  character.  The special symbol '#@' can be used to return the positional
  match of the argument currently being processed.  The /notify switch is
  used to automatically notify the object after the last item in the @dolist
  is processed.  Great for timed events.
  
  The /inline switch may use %d0 to %d9 for ## substitution.  %dL for outer.   
  
  Without /inline, it will not handle %d0-%d9.  The reason is the overhead
  that this would cause would be insufficient for the rewards. 
  
  If present, <switch> can be any of:
    /space     - (Default) List elements are separated by spaces.
    /delimit   - List elements are separated by <delimiter>.
    /notify    - Issues a @notify me after the end of the @dolist
    /pid       - Issues a @notify/pid me=<pid> after the end of the @dolist.
    /inline    - Execute @dolist 'in-line' and do not queue.
    /clearregs - Clear the registers before going inside @dolist.  This 
                 assumes local registers. (/inline required)
    /localize  - Make any changes to registers local (/inline required)
    /nobreak   - All @break/@assert in @dolist ignored in outside processing.
                 (/inline required)
  
{ help @dolist2 for examples}
  
& @dolist2 
  Command: @dolist[/<switch>] [<delimiter>] <list>=<action>  
  
  This command is particularly handy with lcon() and lexits(). A few examples:
 
    @dolist [lcon(here)] = "[name(##)](##)
    @dolist [lcon(here)] = @switch [get(##/last)]=*1990*,"[name(##)]
    @va me = va vb vc
    @dolist [get(me/va)] = @emit [get(me/##)]
    @dolist [get(me/va)] = @emit Argument ## is position #@
    @dolist Frodo Bilbo Gandalf = page ## = HELP!!!!  I've fallen into a pit.
    @dolist/delimit , {Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf} = page ## = HELP!!!!
    @wait me=@emit Zapping Finished;@dolist/notify bob joe=@emit Zapped ##

& @drain
  Command: @drain[</switch>] <object>
  Discards all commands waiting on the semaphore <object> and resets the
  semaphore to its initial state.  Note, you can also use @halt/pid with
  the PID process of the given semaphore.  
  
  Possible switches are:
     /quiet   - omit message notification of any @draining
  
  See Also: @notify, @ps, SEMAPHORES
  
& @eval
  Command: @eval <string>
  
  This function forces the <string> into evaluation.  @eval, by itself,
  does not return anything.  This is useful if you wish to use functions
  (like sideeffects) to set up values and results but not have to use
  a 'normal' command to issue it.
  
  Example:
    > @eval [pemit(me,test)]
    test
  
  See Also: think, @emit, @pemit, pemit()
  
& @edit
  Command: @edit[<switch>] <object>/<wild-attr> = <search>,<replace>
           @edit[<switch>] <object>/<wild-attr> = ^,<text>
           @edit[<switch>] <object>/<wild-attr> = $,<text>
  This command edits the contents of one or more attributes of an object,
  eliminating the need to retype a long attribute in order to make a simple
  change.  In the first form, all occurrences of <search> in the specified
  attribute of the named object are replaced with <replace>.  Use curly
  braces ({ and }) around <search> or <replace> if they contain commas.
  The second and third form prepend and append <text> to the selected
  attributes, respectively.  Changes will be highlighted.  If you do not
  wish the changes to be highlighted, please @toggle yourself with the
  'NO_ANSI_EX' toggle. (syntax: @toggle me=no_ansi_ex).  
  
  The following switches exist for @edit:
        /check     - perform 'check' of what @edit will do w/o editing.
        /single    - perform edit on first match, but not rest.
        /strict    - enforces ansi alignment for each char in original
                     string and leaves unansified anything outside that.
        /raw       - raw mode of the string.  Allows to edit ansi markup.
   
  If <wild-attr> contains wildcard characters, then all attributes that
  match are edited.
  
  Example:
    > @va me=This are a test.
      Set.
    > @edit me/va=are,is
      Set - VA: This is a test
  
  See Also: edit(), editansi(), @mvattr, @cpattr
  
& @emit
  Command: @emit[/<switches>] <message>
  Sends <message> to everyone in your current location without prefixing it by
  your character name.  You can also send the message to everyone in the room
  that contains the object you are inside with the /room switch.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /here   - Sends the message to everyone in the same location as you.
     /room   - Sends the message to everyone in the room that contains the
               object you are in.  Starting from your location, this switch
               'leaves' objects until it reaches a room, and @emits the message
               there.
     /sub    - Substitute '##' in the string for the target's dbref#.  Note,
               that iter(), parse() or any function that also handles ## will
               handle it prior to @emit.
     /noansi - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
               useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
  
  If both /here and /room switches are specified, the message is sent to both 
  places.  If neither is specified, /here is assumed.
 
  Some MUSHes may restrict the use of this command.
  
  See Also: @femit, @oemit, @pemit, SPOOFING
  
& @entrances
  Command: @entrances [[<object>][,<low>[,<high>]]]
 
  Lists links from elsewhere to the specified object (default: your current
  room).  For rooms, exits and drop-to's, leading to the room and players
  and objects whose home is in the room are listed.  For players and objects,
  lists exits leading to them.  Because this command is computationally
  expensive, it costs 200 coins.  <low> and <high> can be used to indicate
  where to start and stop the search, respectively.
 
  Examples:
    > @entrances             <- all links to here
    > @entrances object      <- all links to object
    > @entrances ,100,200    <- all links to here from #100 to #200
    > @entrances me,1000     <- all links to me from #1000 and above.
  
  See Also: @link, @unlink
  
& @femit
  Command: @femit[/<switches>] <object>=<message>
  Forces <object> to emit <message>.  This command is similar to the command
  '@force <object> = @emit <message>', except that it will work so long as
  you own the object, whereas @force may fail if the object has its INHERIT
  flag set and the object performing the @force does not.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /here   - Sends the message to everyone in the same location as <object>.
     /room   - Sends the message to everyone in the room that contains the
               object that <object> is in.  Starting from your location, this
               switch 'leaves' objects until it reaches a room, and @emits the
               message there.
     /noansi - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
               useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
    
  If both /here and /room switches are specified, the message is sent to both 
  places.  If neither is specified, /here is assumed.
   
  Some MUSHes may restrict the use of this command.
    
  See Also: @emit, @fpose, @fsay, INHERIT, SPOOFING
  
& @find
  Command: @find <name>[,<low>[,<high>]]
 
  Displays the name and number of every room, thing, or player that you
  control whose name matches <name>. Because the command is computationally
  expensive, it costs 200 coins.
 
  <low> and <high> may be used to restrict the range of objects that are
  searched, if they are given then the search starts at object #<low> and ends
  at object #<high>.
 
  Examples:
    > @find Lost Room
    > @find Secret Device,12000,14000
  
  See Also: @search
  
& @force
  Command: @force <player/object>=<command>
  Forces the game to act as though <player/object> had entered <command>.
  You may only force objects that you control.  Objects may not force players
  unless either the object or the player has their INHERIT flag set, and
  objects that do not have their INHERIT flag set may not force objects that
  do.  If the victim is specified by number, you may use an alternate form
  of the command, '#<number> <command>'.

  Command: @fpose[/<switches>] <object>=<message>
  Forces <object> to pose <message>.  This command is similar to the command
  '@force <object> = :<message>', except that it will work so long as you
  own the object, whereas @force may fail if the object has its INHERIT flag
  set and the object performing the @force does not.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /default - (default) Put a space between the name of the object and
                the message (ie, send '<name> <message>').
     /nospace - Don't put a space between the name of the object and the
                message (ie, send '<name><message>').
  
  See Also: @femit, @fsay, pose, :, ;, INHERIT
  
& @guild
  Command: @guild[/<switch>] <player>=<string>
  
  This command sets the GUILD attribute on the specified player.  Only
  staff can use this command.  Optional switches are:
    /quiet - sets the attribute w/o returning a 'Set.' message.
    /noisy - this verbosely sets the attribute.  Compatibility with PENN

& @hide
  Command: @hide[/<switch>]
  
  This command will hide (or unhide) you from the WHO/DOING.  If you
  specify the '/off' switch, it will unhide you to appear back on the
  WHO/DOING.  This also effects lwho(), conn() and idle().  Only full
  wizards (and you yourself) can see you on the WHO when you @hide.
  The current switches exist:
     /on  - this hides you from the WHO (default).
     /off - this unhides you from the WHO. 
  
  See Also: WHO, DOING, DARK, UNFINDABLE  
  
& @halt
  Command: @halt[/<switch>] [<object>]
  Halts all commands being run by <object>, or by the object running the
  command if no <object> is given.  If the object to be halted is a player,
  then all commands being run by objects owned by that player are halted.
  Use this command to stop runaway objects and infinite loops.
  The process of halting an object involves removing all commands waiting
  to be run by the object from the queue and refunding the queue deposit.
  Halting an object does not affect commands waiting on it as a semaphore.
  
  Switches available are:
    /PID   - This will halt (kill) the PID reference to the job in the @ps.
             This, unlike @halt alone, *WILL* affect jobs waiting as
             semaphores.
    /STOP  - (used with /PID) - Sets the queue entry into a SLEEP state
    /CONT  - (used with /PID) - Resets the queue entry into a RUN state
    /QUIET - Will quiet the output when you have halted something.
             Note: warnings/errors will still show through this.

& @last
  Command: @last <player>
  This command displays a short 'connection history' for <player>, showing
  recent successful and failed connection attempts, as well as the total
  number of successful and failed connections.
  You can only display information about yourself or people you control.
  
& @link
  Command: @link <object>=#<number>/here/home
  When used on a player or a thing, this command sets the object's home
  to the indicated location.  The destination must be owned by you or be an
  ABODE room, and you must pass the destination's LinkLock.
 
  When used on a room, this command sets the room's drop-to, where objects
  dropped in the room go.  The destination must be a room that is either owned
  by you or is LINK_OK, and you must pass the destination's LinkLock.
 
  For exits, this command sets the destination if the exit is currently
  unlinked, you control the destination or it is set LINK_OK, and you pass the
  destination's LinkLock.  You can @link an unlinked exit regardless of who
  owns it or the lock set on it, you are made the owner if you successfully
  link to the destination.  Linking an exit costs 1 coin, and if the exit was
  owned by someone else, you also reimburse the former owner 1 coin
  (making the total cost to you 2 coins).
  
{ 'help @link2' for more }
  
& @link2
  Note that in all the above cases that it is the player performing the @link
  command that must pass the LinkLock, not the object being linked.
  Therefore, you should use the '$' lock qualifier if you want to prevent
  specific players from linking to your LINK_OK locations, as simply locking
  against '*<playername>' does not lock out their puppets.
 
  You may also @unlink players at your location IF the following conditions
  are met:
    1) You own the location
    2) The player is at your location and that happens to be his home.
    3) there is a valid default home defined for the mush

& @list
  Command: @list [<option> [<subtopic> [<pagenumber>]] 
  
  Lists information from internal databases.  Information is available
  about the following options:
    attributes      - Valid object attributes.
    commands        - Commands that you may use (excluding the 
                      attribute-setting commands as well as any exits, and
                      $-commands available).
    costs           - Lists the costs associated with many commands and
                      actions.
    default_flags   - Lists the flags that new objects receive by default
                      when created.
    flags           - Lists the name and letter of all the flags.
    functions       - Lists all the available functions.
    options         - Lists several global options and limits.
                      You may specify subtopics: boolean, values, config, mail
    switches        - Lists what commands support switches and the switches
                      that they do support.
    toggles         - Lists toggles supported by the mush.
  
  The information provided by the @list command is definitive, as it reads
  the internal tables to produce the information it displays.  Specifying
  @list with no argument lists the options you may use.
  
{help @list2 for a listing of subtopics}
  
& @list2 
  @list2 - Continued
  
  Command: @list [<option> [<subtopic> [<pagenumber>]] 
  
  @list options has subtopics.  You can issue them by: @list options <subtopic>
  @list options subtopics have page values:  @list options <subtopic> <page>
  
  The following topics have sub-topics currently:
    OPTIONS    boolean   - show all available boolean configs you can see.
               values    - show all available values that you can see.
               config    - show all current status/config information.
               mail      - show all current hardcoded mail configuration.
  
  Examples:
    > @list options boolean     (For first page - default)
    > @list options boolean 2   (For second page)

& @listmotd
  Command: @listmotd
  Displays the current message-of-the-day.  Note that it is displayed when
  you connect to your character.
  
& @lock
  Command: @lock[/<whichlock>] <object>=<key>
           @lock <object>/<attrib>
   
  The first form locks <object> to a specific key(s).  Type 'help @lock keys'
  for a list of the keys you may use.
   
  <whichlock> indicates which lock you want to set on the object.  If you
  don't specify one, you set the Default lock. Type 'help @lock locks' for
  a list of the locks you may set and what they are used for.
   
  The second form locks the indicated attribute of the named object, so that
  when the object is @chowned, the attribute will remain owned by you.
  It may also be used when you own an attribute on an object that you do not
  own, in this case it prevents the object's owner from @chowning the
  attribute to himself, and prevents anyone from modifying or removing the
  attribute.  The following sub-topics exist:
   
         help mail lock   - help on how to set a mail lock.
         help @lock keys  - list of valid keys you can use in @locking.
         help @lock locks - list of available locks you can @lock.
         help @lock type <lock> - give detailed help on the specific lock.
         help userlocks   - a special way to define user-defined locking.

                                   in MUSH programming where a user-defined
                                   lock is needed.  This can also be used as

& @lock type ZoneToLock
  Lock Type: ZoneToLock
  Syntax   : @lock/zoneto <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits, Players:
     This allows people who pass the lock to be able to @zone items to your
     zone.  This works similiar to the ParentLock with regards to @parents.
     If the lock does not exist, only those who control the item may @zone it.
  
& @lock type ZoneWizLock
  Lock Type: ZoneWizLock
  Syntax   : @lock/zonewiz <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits, Players:
     This allows people the ability to control and modify anything within that
     zone's realm.  If you pass the lock you will have control, otherwise 
     it will be off limits to you.  If the lock does not exist, only those
     who have power over the target may be able to control and modify it.
     The ZoneWizLock allows the target to modify/examine anything that is
     in that zone as long as it is not WIZARD (bitlevel 5) or higher owned.
     If it is WIZARD or higher owned, then it follows normal permissions on
     that target to what they can do with it.
  
& @lock type TwinkLock
  Lock Type: TwinkLock
  Syntax   : @lock/twink <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits:
     The twinklock is a unique lock in that it will allow anyone who passes
     the lock control over that object.  THIS CAN BE A SECURITY RISK SO BE
     CAREFUL!  The user who passes the lock will ONLY be able to modify/set
     attributes.  They will be unable to set, modify, or remove flags, locks,
     or anything else on the object.  It is generally wise to have objects
     twinklocked be !INHERIT so that abuse will be limited.  If the lock
     does not exist, then NO ONE other than the owner will be able to modify
     that target.
  
  Players:
     Players are special in that just like Rooms, Objects, and Exits, it
     allows direct modification of them as a player, but also in the case
     of player, the TwinkLock is special in that it's an inheritable lock.
     This means if you pass the twinklock of a player, you automatically
     pass that lock on everything that player owns.
  
  Special note:  You can set the item NOMODIFY if you want it to just have
                 examine privalages and not modify privalages.
  
& @lock type UserLock
  Lock Type: UserLock
  Syntax   : @lock/user <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits, Players:
     This is a dummy lock that has no special purpose inside the MUSH.  This
     is meant entirilly for a user-preference.  This is to be used if you 
     have need to set up a lock-mechanism without having to 'block' locks
     on that particular target.
  
  Special Enhancement:  If enabled, this lock also serves as a reality level
     lock.  This in effect allows special 'tweeking' of reality levels so
     that you may specify additional passes through the reality  The target
     must be set CHKREALITY for this lock to work.  The CHKREALITY toggle is
     only settable by WIZARD and higher.  Depending on the current 
     configuration of the locktype (@list options to see) the lock will check 
     if enactor passes lock on target, or if target passes lock on enactor.  It
     will also check if the values are anded or or'd.  The following options 
     exist:
               0 - Reality level or'd with lock pass based on target
               1 - Reailty level or'd with lock pass based on enactor
               2 - Reality level and'd with lock fail based on target
               3 - Reality level and'd with lock fail based on enactor
     
     In condition 2 and 3, if the lock doesn't exist, it assumes pass 
     automatically.
  
& @lock type UseLock
  Lock Type: UseLock
  Syntax   : @lock/use <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits, Players:
     This specifies who may use the object.  Using the object includes giving
     the object money to trigger PAY/COST (@pay/@cost) attributes, being able 
     to USE (@use) the object, triggering any type of listen command or being
     able to use any type of macros (or $-command) commands.  If you do not
     pass the lock, you will be unable to use that object.  If the lock does
     not exist, then anyone will be able to use that object.
  
  Special:  %0 is passed into evaluation locks for uselocks.  The values exist:
     0 -- Default.  Neither a $command or a ^listen (like when you do 'use')
     1 -- $command was triggered
     2 -- ^listen was triggered

  Lock Type: TportLock
  Syntax   : @lock/tport <target>=<key>

     This controls who may teleport INTO the target location ONLY if the
     JUMP_OK flag is set on the room.  If you do not pass the lock, you will
     be unable to @teleport into the room.  If the room is JUMP_OK and there
     is no lock, you may @teleport there freely.

  Lock Type: TeloutLock
  Syntax   : @lock/telout <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Players, Objects:
     This defines who is allowed to teleport OUT of the target location.  If
     you are unable to pass the lock, you will be unable to @teleport out. 
     Keep in mind that 'home' overrides this lock.  If the lock does not
     exist, you may @teleport out freely.  If a room has a TeloutLock, you
     will be unable to teleport out of objects inside it unless you pass it.

     This lock is meaningless on exits.
  
& @lock type SpeechLock
  Lock Type: SpeechLock
  Syntax   : @lock/speech <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Players, Objects:
     This defines who may talk at the target location.  If you do not pass
     the lock, you will be unable to use any type of communication at that
     location.  This includes, say, pose, @emit, @oemit, and the like.
     Admin level 4 and higher override this lock automatically.  If the lock
     does not exist, you will be able to speak freely.
  
  Exits:
     This lock is meaningless on exits.
  
& @lock type DropLock
  Lock Type: DropLock
  Syntax   : @lock/drop <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Exits, Players, Objects:
     This controls who may drop the target item.  If you do not pass the 
     lock you will be unable to drop the item.  If no lock exists, you will
     be able to drop the target freely.

                                   the lock at the enactor location and target
                                   location.
     ChownLock:    All:            Specifies who may chown an item if set
                                   CHOWN_OK.  No lock means anyone can.

& @lock type GiveToLock
  Lock Type: GiveToLock
  Syntax   : @lock/giveto <target>=<key>
  
  Objects, Players, Rooms:
     This controls who may give things AT the location.  If the target passes
     the lock, it will be able to give items while at that location.  If they
     do not pass the lock, they will be forbidden to give anything (except 
     money) at that location.  If the lock does not exist, giving items in 
     that location behaves normally (based on permissions and any GiveLocks).
  
  Exits:
     This lock is meaningless on exits.
  
& @lock type GetFromLock
  Lock Type: GetFromLock
  Syntax   : @lock/getfrom <target>=<key>
  
  Objects, Players, Rooms:
     This controls who may get things AT the location.  If the target passes
     the lock, it will be able to get items while at that location.  If they
     do not pass the lock, they will be forbidden to get anything while at
     that location.  If the lock does not exist, getting items in that 
     location behaves normally (based on permissions and locks on items).
     This checks first the lock at the enactor's location, THEN it checks
     the lock at the target location.  If either of those locks are not passed
     then the target may not be gotten by the enactor.
  
  Exits:
     This lock is meaningless on exits.
  
& @lock type DropToLock
  Lock Type: DropToLock
  Syntax   : @lock/dropto <target>=<key>
  
  Objects, Rooms:
     This controls who may drop items AT the location.  If the player
     passes the lock, they will be permitted to drop items at that location.
     If they do not pass the lock, they will be forbidden to drop anything
     at that location.  If the lock does not exist, dropping items will
     behave normally (based on permissions and any DropLocks).
  
  Exits, Players:
     This lock is meaningless on players and exits.
  
& @lock type OpenLock
  Lock Type: OpenLock
  Syntax   : @lock/open <target>=<key>
  
  Objects, Rooms:
     This controls who may open exits AT the location.  If the player
     passes the lock, they will be allowed to open an exit out from that
     room.  If the lock does not exist, permission to open exits at
     that location will behave normally.
  
  Players, Exits:
     This lock is meaningless on players and exits.
  
& @lock type DarkLock
  Lock Type: DarkLock
  Syntax   : @lock/dark <target>=<key>
  
  Objects, Players, Exits:
     This controls who may see the item if it is DARK at the location they
     look at.  If they already had control of the object, this lock is
     meaningless.  If the lock does not exist, DARK items are treated
     normally.
  
  Rooms:
     This controls the darkness level of the room to the player.  If the
     player passes the lock, that room will be considered NOT DARK for that
     player.  If the lock does not exist, the dark room will be treated
     normally.  Please note that all items inside that room that are dark
     are treated on a seperate basis for the DarkLocks.
  
& @lock type ChownLock
  Lock Type: ChownLock
  Syntax   : @lock/chown <target>=<key>
  
  Rooms, Objects, Exits:
    This controls who may @chown an item if it was previously set with
    the CHOWN_OK flag.  If this lock does not exist, then anyone may
    chown an item set CHOWN_OK.  This lock works on all types except
    players who always own themselves.
  
  Players:
    This lock is meaningless for players, as is the CHOWN_OK flag.
  
& @Lock keys
 
  You may use the following keys when setting locks.  For information about
  a particular type of key, type:
  
                          'help @lock <Key Type>'.
 
  Key Type    Form in @Lock Command
  ----------  ------------------------------
  Normal      <object>
  Is          =<object>
  Carry       +<object>
  Ownership   $<object>
  Indirect    @<object>
  Attribute   <attribute>:<wildcard-pattern>

              ( <key> )
  
  Note: Evaluation locks pass '%0' for uselocks.  
        0 -- default (like when using 'use')
        1 -- $command is checked
        2 -- ^listen is checked
   
& @lock attribute
  ATTRIBUTE LOCKS:
 
  Key: <attribute>:<pattern>
       +<attribute>:<wildcard-pattern>
       =<attribute>:<wildcard-pattern>
 
  You may lock on whether a specific attribute on the player attempting to
  pass the lock matches a pattern.  Example: '@lock thing=sex:m*' will lock
  thing to anyone whose sex starts with an M. Wild cards, greater than and
  less than may be used, for example: '@lock a-f=name:<g' will lock the exit
  a-f against any one whose name is higher than f.
 
  Both the player testing the lock and every object in his inventory is
  checked, the player passes the lock if any of those objects passes the lock.
  If the attribute name is prefixed by a = then only the player is checked.
  Similarly, if the attribute name is prefixed by a + then only objects in
  the player's inventory are tested.
   
{ 'help @lock attribute2' for more }
  
& @lock attribute2
  Note: you may lock against any attribute, but the locked object must be
  able to read the attribute from the player attempting to pass the lock or
  the lock will fail.
 
  Examples:
    > @lock men's room=sex:m*
    > @lock a-f=name:<g
    > @lock post office=email:*@*
  
  See Also: ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP, @lock evaluation
  
& @lock evaluation
  EVALUATION LOCKS:
 
  Key: <attribute>/<value>
 
  Evaluation locks let you evaluate one of your attributes and compare the 
  result against a value stored in the lock.  The result must be an exact
  match (no wildcarding allowed, but uppercase and lowercase are considered
  to be the same).  When evaluating the attribute the enactor substitutions
  (%#/%n/etc) are replaced with information about the player trying to pass
  the lock, and 'me' and %! refer to the locked object or exit.
 
  If you call an indirect lock and the indirect lock is an evaluation lock
  (or is a compound lock that includes an evaluation lock), then the original
  lock object is checked for the attribute first, followed by the object that
  has the actual evaluation lock.  If there are multiple levels of indirection
  the intermediate locks are not checked.
   
{ 'help @lock evaluation2' for more }
  
& @lock evaluation2
  Examples:
    > @lock bank=checkmoney/1
    > &checkmoney bank=[gt(money(%#),5000)]
    Only people and objects with more than 5000 pennies may pass.
    Note: this lock requires wizard privileges to read the worth of other
    players.
 
    > @lock divisible_by_five_club = checkdiv/0
    > &checkdiv divisible_by_five_club = [mod(mid(%#,2,20),5)]
    Only objects whose db-number is divisible by 5 may pass.
  
  See Also: @lock attributes
  
& @lock indirect
  INDIRECT LOCKS:
 
  Key: @<object>
 
  You may reference the lock on another object and use the result of
  evaluating that other object's lock.    You pass an indirect lock if you
  pass the default lock on <object>.  This is especially useful if you
  have a large number of objects or exits that want to have the same lock,
  and you want to be able to update one object and have all the other
  locks change at the same time.
 
  <object> is searched for when you enter the @lock command and its
  database number is stored in the lock, so something like
  '@Lock north=@master.lock' is safe even if you are going to move master.lock
  to another location.
 
  Examples:
    > @lock master.lock = me
    > @lock north = @master.lock
    > @lock south = @master.lock
    North and south all reference the lock on master.lock, so you may change
    the lock on all three exits by changing master.lock.
  
  See Also: @lock normal
  
& @lock normal
  NORMAL LOCKS:
 
  Key: <object>
 
  You pass a normal lock if you either are the named object or if you carry
  the named object.  <object> may be the name or #number of a thing,  a
  playername prefixed by an asterisk (*<playername>), 'me', or 'here'.
 
  Examples:
    > @lock treasure room = secret key
    > @lock private area = me
  
  See Also: @lock is, @lock carry
  
& @lock is
  IS LOCKS:
 
  Key: =<object>
 
  You pass an is lock only if you are the named object.
 
  Example:
    > @lock mystical highway = =magic bus
    Only the magic bus may travel down the mystical highway.  You cannot
    travel the highway if you are carrying the bus.
  
  See Also: @lock carry, @lock normal
  
& @lock carry
  CARRY LOCKS:
 
  Key: +<object>
 
  You pass a carry lock if you are carrying the named object.
 
  Example:
    > @lock secret passage = +magic bus
    You can only traverse the secret passage if you are carrying the
    magic bus.  The bus cannot enter the passage on its own (perhaps
    when you are driving it).
  
  See Also: @lock is, @lock normal
  
& @lock ownership
  OWNERSHIP LOCKS:
 
  Key: $<object>
 
  You pass an ownership lock if you have the same owner as <object>.
 
  Examples:
    > @lock mystuff=$me
    Only objects you own may use the mystuff exit.
 
    > @lock/page me = !$*TinyJerk
    Neither TinyJerk nor any of his objects may page you.
  
  See Also: @lock normal
  
& @lock compound
  COMPOUND LOCKS:
 
  Key: <key> & <key>
       <key> | <key>
       !<key>
       ( <key> )
 
  You can make complex locks by combining keys with the logical AND and OR
  operators (& and ! respectively), or by using the NOT operator.  You
  may also group complex locks with parentheses.
 
  Examples:
    > @lock exit = me & !me
    An impossible lock, nothing can be both you and not you.
 
    > @lock message = me | *recipient
    Both you and the player recipient may get the message.
  
& @mvattr
  Command: @mvattr <object>=<old>,<new>[,<copy1>]...
  This command moves attributes around on an object.  The attribute <old> is
  renamed <new> (and is copied to <copy1>, <copy2> and so on if specified).
  If you cannot modify the <old> attribute (for instance if you are trying to
  move the Last attribute, or if it were owned by another player), then a new
  copy is made and the original is not removed.  If you are trying to move
  the attribute into an attribute that you have no permission over, then
  the original attribute is not deleted.
  
  See Also: @set, @cpattr
  
& @wall
  Command: @wall <message>
  This command allows even mortals (if set at RhostMUSH default) to
  @wall to everyone on the mush.  Keep in mind this is expensive.
  (default of 500 gold - @list costs shows how much it is currently worth)
  And also keep in mind to not abuse it, else the wizards may show their
  wrath.
  
  See Also: NO_YELL, NO_WALLS, COSTS
  
& @GREP
  Command: @grep[/<switch>] <object>=<attribute(s)>,<string>
  
  This command will return a list of attributes matching <attribute(s)> that
  contain the string <string>.  You may specify wildcards (* or ?) in the
  attributes or the string to match for.  If no list is found, it returns
  nothing.
  
  The following switches exist for @grep:
    /quiet  - filters out the output of the 'Grep: Done.' message
    /regexp - apply regular expression matching for 'string'.
  
  Example: 
  > @grep me=*,*al*
    Sex
    Grep: Done. 
   
  See Also: @search, examine, get(), match(), grep()
  
& @CPATTR
  Command: @cpattr[/switch] <obj>/<old>=<obj>[/<new1>/<new2/...][,<obj2>...]
  
  This command copies attributes from one object to a destination object(s).
  You can only copy from objects and attributes you control and only onto
  objects and attributes you control.  You have to specify a valid attribute
  to copy as well.  There are switches available for @cpattr.  These are:
      /clear  - this erases the attribute on the originating object if
                a copy was successful.
  
  You may specify the same object if you wish to move attributes on the same
  object.  You may specify wildcards for attributes.
  
{ 'help cpattr2' for examples on all combinations and explanations }
  
& CPATTR2
  Command: @cpattr (Continued 2 of 3)
  Syntax:  @cpattr <object>/<attribute>=<object1>/<attr1>/<attr2>
    
      - This will copy the given attribute to 'attr1' and 'attr2' of the
        the destination object.  You may specify from one to any number
        of destination attributes.
  
  Syntax: @cpattr <object>/<attribute>=<object1>,<object2>/<attr1>
  
      - This will copy the given attribute to an attribute of the same name
        on the first object and copy it with the name 'attr1' on the second
        object.  Any number of objects may be listed.  You may specify
        multiple attributes per object as well.
 
  Syntax: @cpattr <object>/<wildcard>=<object1>,...,<objectX>
 
      - This will copy all attributes matching the wildcard to the destination
        object(s).  You may specify from one to any number of destination
        objects but must control the objects to copy the attributes.
   
{ 'help cpattr3' for more }
  
& CPATTR3
  Command: @cpattr (Continued 3 of 3)
  Syntax: @cpattr <attribute>=<object>/<attrib>,...
  
      - This copies the attribute on the ENACTOR to the target.  You can
        specify multiple targets.
  
  Syntax: @cpattr/clear <args>
 
      - The clear switch is usable with all the previous mentioned @cpattr
        commands. (help cpattr2 for help on these).  This will work just like
        the prior, except this will also purge (remove) the attributes that
        are being copied from the original object.  This acts basically like
        a move.
 
  @cpattr returns detailed information of objects copied from and to and
  any attributes successfully copied.
   
  See Also: @mvattr, @set, &
  
& @name
  Command: @name <object> = <new name>
  
  Changes the name of <object>.  <object> can be a thing, player, exit, or
  room, specified as <name> or #<dbref> or 'me' or 'here'.
 
  See '@list options' as to whether or not a player name may contain 
  spaces.  The default for RhostMUSH is to disallow spaces in player names.
  
  See Also: name(), @protect, @list options, @alias, @ansiname, @extansi, 
            @caption, @titlecaption
  
& @notify
  Command: @notify[/<switches>] <object>[=<count|pid>]
  Notifies the semaphore <object>, running the first command that waited on
  <object> using the '@wait <object>=<command>' or '
  @wait <object>/<time>=<command>' forms of the @wait command.  If <count> is
  specified, it indicates the number of times the semaphore is notified.
  If there are no commands (or less than <count> commands) pending for
  <object>, then subsequent @waits will not block until the semaphore count
  reaches zero again.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /first - (default) Notify the first command waiting on the indicated
              semaphore (or the first <count> commands).
     /all   - Notify all commands waiting on the semaphore and reset the
              semaphore count to zero.  <count> is ignored.
     /pid   - Notify the command on <object> that matches the pid <pid>.
     /quiet - Issue the notify quietly.  This can be mixed with any of
              the other switches.
 
  See Also: @drain, @ps, @wait, SEMAPHORES, @halt
  
& @oemit
  Command: @oemit[/<switch>] <player>=<message>
  Emits <message> to everyone in your current location except for <player>.
  
  The following switches are available:
     /noansi -- Show unevaluated ansi codes.
     /multi  -- take <player> as a multi-target argument.
  
  See Also:  @emit, @pemit, SPOOFING
  
& @open
  Command: @open[/<switches>] <direction list> [=<number>[,<direction list>]]
  Creates an exit in the specified direction(s). If <number> is specified,
  it is linked to that room. Otherwise, it is created unlinked. You or anyone
  else may use the '@link' command to specify where the unlinked exit leads.
  Opening an exit costs 1 coin. If you specify <number>, linking costs 1 more
  coin.  You can specify a second direction list (after the comma), which is 
  automatically opened in the room that the new exit goes TO and which is
  linked back to where you are.  I.e.  @open north;n=#1234,south;s
  would open exit 'north;n' from here to #1234, and an exit 'south;s'
  from #1234 to here, assuming you have rights to open exits and link to
  the rooms in question.
  
  Note:  To make variable exits, you @toggle the exit VARIABLE then set
         an appropiate @exitto on it.
   
  The following switches are available:
     /location  - Create the exit in your location (default).
     /inventory - Create the exit on yourself.
   
  See Also: @dig, @link, LINKING
  
& @parent
  Command: @parent <object> [=<parent>]
  This command sets the parent of <object> to <parent> (or clears the parent
  if <parent> is omitted.  You must control <object>, and must own <parent>.
  
  If you are parenting rooms, and wish some of the exits of that room to
  not be inherited, set the PRIVATE flag on those exits.
  
  See Also: PARENT OBJECTS., parents(), parent(), children()
  
& PARENT OBJECTS
  Topic: PARENT OBJECTS
 
  Parent objects provide a way for several objects to inherit common
  attributes, exits, and $-commands from a single object, so that changing
  the parent object affects all of its children.  When searching for
  attributes or exits, first the object itself is checked, then the parent
  is checked only if the object does not have what was searched for.
 
  Any attribute the parent object has will be passed down to its children,
  if they don't already have one. For instance, if the child object has no
  description, it will inherit the description of its parent.
 
  Any exits the parent object has will show up in the exit list of the
  child, and may be used as normal exits.  If you do not wish this, set
  the exit PRIVATE.
 
  The parent is searched for $-commands as well as the child, and all
  attributes of both parent and child are checked, even if there are
  conflicting attribute names.  If both have an attribute named "cmd1",
  both the parent's and child's "cmd1" attributes are checked for a
  $-command.

& ANCESTORS
& PARENT2 
  Topic: PARENT OBJECTS (continued)
 
  A parent object may itself have a parent, up to a configurable limit
  (usually 10 levels).  The parent need not be the same type as its children,
  and flags are not inherited from parent objects.  However, a UseLock
  is inherited.  IE: if the parent is uselocked against you, you can not
  use it's functionality.  You may not create parent loops.
 
  The parent system inheritance in RhostMUSH is rather robust.  When 
  attributes are looked up it follows a chain of inheritance rules.
  Lookups are in the following order for attribute lookups:
  
    1.  Does attribute exist on object?
    2.  Does attribute exist in physical parent?
        A.  If attribute is set NOINHERIT this is ignored.
        B.  See: help @parent
    3.  Does attribute exist in any of the zones it belongs to?
        A.  If attribute is set NOINHERIT this is ignored.
        B.  The zonemaster must be set ZONEPARENT for inheritance.
        C.  If object is toggled NOZONEPARENT this is ignored.
        D.  See: help zones and help zoneparent
    4.  Does attribute exist on any by-type global parents (virtual).
        A.  If attribute is set NOINHERIT this is ignored.
        B.  If object is toggled NOGLOBPARENT this is ignored.
        C.  See: wizhelp global_parent_<type> (room|thing|player|exit).
    5.  Does attribute exist on the generic global parent (virtual).
        A.  If attribute is set NOINHERIT this is ignored.
        B.  If object is toggled NOGLOBPARENT this is ignored.
        C.  See: wizhelp global_parent_obj
  
  All attribute fetches take normal rules regarding normal attribute
  permissions in addition to the rules previously mentioned.

& @pemit
  Command: @pemit[/switches] <what>=<message>
           @pemit/toreality/contents[/list] <realities>/<what>=<message>
  
  Emits <message> only to <what>, or to <what>'s contents of the /contents
  switch is given.  <what> must be either in the same location as you or
  be something you own.  You can also @pemit to distant players if
  pagelocks allow you to page them, and this costs as much as a page
  <This feature is not present in all MUSHes>.  You cannot @pemit to the
  contents of something you don't own.  You may combine switches.
  
  The following switches are available:
    /contents  - Send the message to the contents of the named object.
    /object    - Send the message to the named object.
    /silent    - Same as /object, for PENN compatibility
    /noisy     - Send to the enactor of the command what was pemitted.
    /zone      - Send to the specified zone (if not a zonemaster)
                 Send to all rooms in a zone (if a zonemaster)
    /nosub     - When used in junction with /list, it will keep ## and #@
                 from evaluating.
    /noansi    - Show the string literally and don't process ansi.  Only
                 useful with ZENTY_ANSI enabled (at compiletime).
  
{ help @pemit2 to continue switches listing }
  
& @pemit2
  The following switches are available: (continued)
    /list      - Send the message to the given list of players.
                 For this, it parses '##'s just like @dolist or iter().
                 Example: @pemit/list #1 #2 #3=hello ##!
                          @pemit/list #1 #2 #3=hello ## (number #@)
                 (The first would return 'Hello #1!' to #1 and so forth)
                 (The second would return 'Hello #1 (number 1)' and so forth)
    /noeval    - Do not evaluate string.
    /reality   - Will check the reality level of the target to see if the
                 target will be able to see the message based on the
                 reality level check.  Need REALITY_LEVELS compiled in.
    /toreality - specify the realities you wish to @pemit to.  Note:  this
                 is only useful for the /content switch.
    /oneeval   - By default @pemit evaluates for every person in /list.
                 This forces a single evaluation.  It assumes /nosub by 
                 default.  This can only be used with the /list switch.

    Note: /toreality has unique syntaxing.  Examples follow:
  
    Syntax:  @pemit/toreality/contents <reality1 ... realityX>/<target>=<msg> 
             @pemit/toreality/list/con <reality1 ... realityX>/<targets>=<msg>
    
    Example: @pemit/toreality/con Invis Umbra/here=Only Umbra and Invis sees.
                
  See Also: page, @emit, @oemit, SPOOFING
  
& @pipe
  Command: @pipe[/<switch>] [<attribute>]
 
  This command will allow you to pipe output that you would normally see on
  your screen into a specified attribute.  You must have permission to write
  to the attribute, the attribute must be a valid attribute name, and the
  attribute can not be full (or it'll auto-disable upon attempt).  The 
  attribute is also always on the enactor.  You can't specify another object.
  The following switches are used:
    /on     -- Turn on piping to the specified attribute.  
    /off    -- Turn off piping to the attribute.
    /tee    -- This turns on piping but also allows viewing output normally.
    /status -- This gives the current status of your piping.
  
  Please note, you obviously can not pipe to multiple attributes at once,
  and once the attribute is filled to capacity, piping to that attribute
  will be automatically disabled and output will return to your screen
  as normal.  If you specify /tee output will occur normally to your screen
  but you will still be notified if the attrib is filled or an error
  occured while writing output to it.
  
  If you @toggle yourself NOISY, then every output segment that would show
  up on your screen will notify you that it was piped to the file.  This
  can be spammy, but it is useful if you want some notification and you
  have not used /tee.
  
  If you are still piping to an attribute, it will notify you of this upon
  connection, regardless of the NOISY @toggle. 
  
  You can not use this feature if you are set NO_CODE, GUEST, or WANDERER. 
  
  Example:
    > @pipe/on BOO;WHO;@pipe/off 
    Piping to attribute has been enabled.
    Piping to attribute has been disabled.
    > think v(boo)
    Player Name          On For Idle  Guild       Doing
    Tester                00:01   0s  Citizen
    1 Player logged in. (Bummer.)

& @ps
  Command: @ps[/<switches>] [<object>]
  
  Lists information about the commands you have on each of the queues.
  Unless the /summary switch is used, this command lists all the commands you
  have on the queues, optionally along with their enactor and arguments.
  Commands scheduled to be executed at a later time (by the @wait command)
  also show the number of seconds until they will be executed and/or the
  semaphore on which they are waiting.  If <object> is specified, only
  commands run by <object> are listed, otherwise all commands run by any of
  your objects is listed.  A summary of the number of commands listed and the
  total number of commands in the queues is also displayed.  This command is
  useful for identifying infinite loops in programs.  You will find PID
  processes by each job in the queue.  These can be killed by PID by using
  the @halt/pid if you have control to kill that job.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /brief   - (default) Display a brief summary that shows the semaphore
                number, time-to-wait, object running the command, and the
                command to be run.
     /long    - In addition to the information in the /brief report, display
                the name and number of the object that caused the command
                to be run (the enactor) and the arguments to the command.
     /summary - Display just the queue counts.
     /all     - this displays all the processes that you have control over.
   
  See Also: @notify, @wait, @drain, @halt, pid()
  
& @quota
  Command: @quota
  Two forms:
 
  There are two forms of the @quota command.
    ALTERNATE :  Alternate quota gives a more enhanced view and tighter player
                 control over the use of their quota.  The draw back to this
                 is it can be somewhat confusing and overpowering for new
                 users.  This quota shows specific quota left and used for
                 all areas of building (rooms, objects, exits, players) and
                 allows the user to move around quota in various areas.
  
    STANDARD  :  Standard quota (the default) is the simple quota system 
                 that shows total quota, used quota,  and quota left.  This 
                 will not give you a breakdown of what quota is used where, 
                 but you can do this with the @stat command (help @stat) for 
                 a simplified showing.
 
  For help on each of the quota systems, type in 'help @quota alternate' for
  the alternate quota system or 'help @quota standard' for the standard
  (and default) quota system.
  
  See Also: @quota standard, @quota alternate
                
& @quota standard
  Command: @quota [<player>] [=<value>]
 
  @quota in the standard system will show you either quota that you have or
  quota that a given player has (if you have power over that player).
 
  Typing either '@quota' (with no arguments) or '@quota me' 
  (or @quota <yourname>) will give you your own personal quota information.
  
  Staff who are able (or those empowered to do so) may at anytime change
  the quota of a player by typing a numeric value after an equals.
  IE:  @quota <targetplayer>=<value>
  
  See Also: @quota alternate, @quota
  
& @quota alternate
  Command: @quota[[/<switches>] [<arguments>]] [<player>] [=<value>]
  
  @quota for RhostMUSH has been seriously revamped.  There exists a lot of 
  options not previously available.  For one, @quota now gives detailed areas 
  that quota is currently divided.  Secondly, it allows the user to move quota 
  into various areas or set up automatic transfer as they wish.  It gives the 
  players a better control of their quota use.  The following switches and 
  options are available:
  
  /take me=<order> - this allows the user to specify the order in which quota 
                     will be transferred when a given area runs out.  Note.
                     Quota is automatically taken from your general pool, 
                     first.  Valid arguments are R, E, T, P for ROOM, EXIT, 
                     THING, PLAYER (robots).
  /xfer me=#,x,y   - This allows you to manually transfer free quota from one 
                     area to another. The '#' is the amount of quota to move,
                     'x' is the area to move from, and 'y' is the area to move
                     to.  Valid arguments are R, E, T, P, G for 'x' and 'y'.
                     They stand for [R]oom, [E]xit, [T]hing, [P]layer, and
                     [G]eneral. 
  
{ For more, type: help quota alternate2 }
  
& quota alternate2
  Command: @quota[[/<switches>] [<arguments>]] [<player>] [=<value>]
  
  /all [me]        - This is an optional switch to display all quota areas you
                     have.
  /room [me]       - This displays your room quota.
  /general [me]    - This displays your general quota.
  /thing [me]      - This displays your thing quota.
  /exit [me]       - This displays your exit quota.
  /player [me]     - This displays your player quota.
  /clear [me]      - used in junction with take. This clears (resets)
                     the given status. 
  
  To see how to set quota in alternate system, type 'help quota alternate3'
  
  See Also: @create, @dig, @open, @quota standard, @quota
  
& quota alternate3
  Command: @quota[/<switches>] <player>=<value>
 
  This will set the specific quota for players on the specific values.
  The following switches exist:
  
  /general         - This shows (or sets) the GENERAL quota for a player.
  /thing           - This shows (or sets) the THING quota for a player.
  /player          - This shows (or sets) the PLAYER quota for a player.
  /exit            - This shows (or sets) the EXIT quota for a player.
  /all             - This shows (or sets) ALL quota for a player.
  /set             - This specifies you wish to set/reset a player's quota.
 
  Please note that if you do not specify the /set but give a value for quota,
  the /set is assumed and established.  You also may not set above the MAX 
  quota of that player. (It will default to the max value if you try to 
  exceed it).  If the player needs more MAX quota, refer to a royalty or 
  higher.
  
& @race
  Command: @race[/<switch>] <player>=<string>
  
  This sets the RACE attribute on the targeted player.  Only staff can set
  this attribute.  The following switches are available:
    /quiet - This suppresses the 'Set.' message when you set the attribute.
    /noisy - This verbosely prints the setting message.
  
  See Also: @guild, race(), guild(), @set, &
  
& @register
  Command: @register <character>=<email>
  This registers a character on-line and mails the specified <email> the 
  password for the character you created.  This can only be done by GUEST and
  only if the autoregistration is enabled.  Depending on configurations, you
  may be able to do this at the connect screen as well, except it's just
  'register'.
  
& @robot
  Command: @robot <name>=<password>
  Creates a robot player owned by you.  The robot has its ROBOT flag set, so
  it may use the OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands that most publicly
  available robot programs require.  This command costs 1000 coins.
  Note that some sites do not restrict OUTPUTSUFFIX and OUTPUTPREFIX to
  robots.
  
  See Also: OUTPUTPREFIX, OUTPUTSUFFIX, ROBOT, TYPES OF OBJECTS
  
& @search
  Command: @search[/<switch> [<player>] [<class>=<restrict>[,<low>[,<high>]]]
 
  Displays information about objects that meet the search criteria.
  Because this command is computationally expensive, it costs 200 coins.
  <player> restricts the search to the named player, while <class>
  and <restrict> control the objects listed.  Type 'help search classes'
  for a list of the classes you may use.
  
  Except when getting lists of players ('@search type=player' or
  '@search flags=P'), you may only search for objects that you own.
  You may limit the range of the search with <low> and <high>, which specify
  the objects to start and stop the search at, respectively.  The default for
  <low> is #0 and the default for <high> is the last object in the database.
  
  The following switches exist for @search:
      /nogarbage     - (immortal only) search without garbage/recover checks.
  
  Examples:
    @search flags=PWc              <-- search for connected wizards.
    @search type=room              <-- list all rooms owned by me.
    @search eval=gt(money(##),10)  <-- search for things worth more than 10.
    @search type=room,100,300      <-- Rooms between #100 and #300, inclusive
    @search object=Test,5000       <-- Things starting with Test from object
                                       #5000 to the end of the database.
  
  See Also: @find, search(), searchng(), SEARCH CLASSES
  
& @set
  Command: @set[/<switches>] <object>=[!]<flag> [[!]<flag> [!]<flag> ...]
           @set[/<switches>] <object>=<attribute>:<value>
           @set[/<switches>] <object>=<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>
           @set[/<switches>] <object>/<attr>=[!]<attrflag>
  Synonym: &<attribute> <object>[=<value>]
 
  The available switches are:
        /QUIET - sets/removes the target without the 'Set.' or 'Cleared.' 
        /NOISY - sets/removes the target with a verbose SET message.
        /TREE  - sets a TREE (with branches) of a given attribute.
   
  The first form sets (or clears) the indicated flag(s) on <object>, It 
  accepts multiple flags for arguments if so desired. the second form sets 
  the <attribute> attribute on <object> to <value>, creating a new user-named 
  attribute if there is no attribute named <attribute>.  The third form 
  copies an attribute from another object, and the fourth form sets 
  (or clears) an attribute flag on the <attr> attribute of <object>.
   
  When setting attributes on an object, you may also use the command
  '@<attribute> <object> = <value>' if the attribute is a predefined
  attribute.  You may also use the command '&<attribute> <object> = <value>'
  to set either predefined attributes or user-named attributes.  Either of
  these is equivalent to the second form of the @set command.
  
  Attributes must start with an alpha character, or in special cases any
  of the following characters: ~_#.+
  
  The /tree switch is ignored on anything not regarding setting or clearing
  attributes.  If any branch in the specified defined tree-attribute is 
  not allowed to be set, the entire attribute itself will not be set either. 
  
{ 'help @set2' for more }
& @set2
  The following flags may be set using the fourth form of the @set command:
     no_command  ($) - Prevent $-commands and ^-patterns defined in the 
                       attribute from being performed.
     no_inherit  (I) - Prevents children of the object from obtaining the 
                       attribute.  From their perspective the attribute does
                       not exist.  This works on ZMO's as well.
     visual      (V) - Anyone may see the attribute when they examine you, and
                       may get the attribute with get().
     no_clone    (N) - The attribute will not be copied to the @cloned object.
     no_parse    (n) - The attribute will not parse %%0 to %%9 with $commands
     hidden      (M) - The attribute is visual only to wizards.
     god         (G) - Only #1 can modify the attribute.
     dark        (D) - Only #1 can see the attribute.
     pinvisible  (p) - Only wizard can see the attr, but anyone can modify it.
     immortal    (i) - Only immortal and higher can modify the attribute.
     royalty     (W) - Only wizard and higher can modify the attribute.
     wizard          - This is an alias for 'royalty'
     councilor   (a) - Only councilor and higher can modify the attribute.
     architect   (B) - Only architect and higher can modify the attribute.
     guildmaster (g) - Only guildmaster and higher can modify the attribute.
     locked      (+) - This happens if you @lock thing/attr the attribute.
     safe        (s) - The attribute can not be modified.
                  
  Please note, you can not set multiple attributes or flags at once this way.

& @stats
  Command: @stats[/all] [<player>]
  Display the number of objects in the game.  @stats/all gives a
  breakdown by object types.  If <player> is specified, the breakdown
  for the named player is given.  You may only list individual counts
  for yourself.  If invoked with no arguments or switches this command is
  free, but if you specify either /all or <player>, then this  command costs
  200 coins to run, because it is computationally expensive.
  
  See Also: stats(), @search
  
& @sweep
  Command: @sweep[/<switches>]
  This command tells you all of the objects, players, and exits that are
  listening in the room you are currently in, as well as the objects you are
  carrying.  Most objects only listen for a particular string or phrase, so
  they normally do not pose a problem if you need privacy.  You will have to 
  be careful of players, puppets, and audible exits since they will hear
  everything you say and do.  There are several switches that may be used to
  limit the type of listeners that are checked for.  They are:
     /here      - Check the room I am in.
     /inventory - Check my inventory.
     /exits     - Check exits in the room.
     /commands  - Check for objects that have $-commands set on them.
     /connected - Check for connected players and their puppets.
     /listeners - Check for objects with @listen set to something.
     /players   - Check for players and their puppets, whether or not they
                  are connected.
 
  The default is to search for everything.  If you specify one or more
  switches from either category (either location or listener type then only
  that location or listener type is checked.
  
  See Also: @listen, AUDIBLE, PUPPETS
  
& @switch
  Command: @switch[/<switches>] <string>=<t1>,<c1> [,<tN>,<cN>]... [,<cD>]
  Compares <string> against the targets <t1>, <t2>, etc, until a match is
  found, at which time the corresponding list of commands is performed.
  Wildcards, and the < and > operators are allowed in the targets.  By
  default, any list whose target matches the string is executed (the targets
  are not mutually exclusive). If no target matches, the default list
  <cD> is executed.
   
  The following switches are available:
     /all      - (default) Perform the actionlists associated with all targets
                 that match <string>.
     /first    - Perform only the actionlist associated with the first target
                 that matches <string>.
     /case     - Allow case sensitivity in matches.  Only for /first and /all.
     /regall   - Same as /all but use regular expression matching. 
     /regfirst - Same as /first but use regular expression matching.
     /notify   - This issues a @notify on the object after @switch executes.
     /inline   - process command 'inline' and don't queue it.
     /clearreg - if inline, clear registers for each arguement
     /localize - if inline, localize registers for each argument
     /nobreak  - if inline, keep breaks localized per argument
  
  If configured, you may use #$ as a substition.   #$ is substituted with 
  the value of <string>. In this way, the commands in <c1>..<cN>..<cD> 
  have a short-hand way of getting at the matched value.  Case does not do
  wildcard matches.
  
  Please check @list options if this has been enabled.

& @teleport
  Simple:  @teleport [<object>=] <location>
  Complex: @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] <room/thing>
           @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] <exit>
           @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] home
   
  The first form of the complex command moves <object> (or you) to the named
  room or thing.  The second form sends <object> (or you) to the destination
  of the named exit, while the third form sends <object> (or you) home.
  If the destination room has a drop-to, the object will go to the drop-to
  instead of the named location.
  
  For the first form of the @teleport command, the object being teleported 
  must pass its location's TeloutLock; and you must control the destination,
  or it must be JUMP_OK and you must pass the destination's TportLock.
 
  The second and third forms let you remove any object from locations you
  control by sending them through an exit or to their home.
  
  The following switches exist for @teleport:
     /list  - specify a list of things to teleport
     /quiet - teleports the target quietly bypassing all messages on them.
              (This is only available to councilor and higher)

& @teleport2
  Simple:  @teleport [<object>=] <location>
  Complex: @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] <room/thing>
           @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] <exit>
           @teleport[/switch] [<obj1,obj2,...>=[dest1, dest2,...]] home
  
  With the use of the /list, you are able to specify multiple objects.
  You can either specify a single destination for all of them, or
  separate destinations for each one.  If you have more objects than
  destinations (minus the fact of having one single destination), than
  the excess objects are ignored.  Likewise, if you have more destinations
  than objects, the excess destinations are ignored.  The destination list
  must be separated by commas as shown if more than one destination is
  given.
 
  Examples:
    @tel/list #45 #54 #46=home    - teleport #45 #54 #46 all home
    @tel/list #45 #54=#0,#584     - teleport #45 to #0 and #54 to #584
    @tel #45=home                 - teleport #45 home
    @tel home                     - teleport the enactor home
    @tel/list/quiet #45 #56=#59   - teleport #45 and #56 to #59 quietly
    @tel/quiet #45=home           - teleport #45 home quietly
  
  See Also: JUMP_OK, @lock (tport and telout), @tfail, @otfail, @atfail
  
& @trigger
  Command: @trigger <object>/<attr> [=<param> [, <param>]... ]
  Invokes an action list stored in an attribute on an object.  The triggering
  object becomes the enactor and the positional parameters %0 through %9
  are set to the supplied parameters.  If a @charges attribute exists on 
  the object being triggered, that attribute is reduced by one and when
  it reaches 0, can no longer be triggered.  You may specify the /command
  switch to trigger attributes that start with $command sequences.  This
  switch is ignored on attributes without $command sequences.
  
  The following switches exist for @trigger:
      /quiet   - Don't report the 'trigger' message when triggering.  
      /command - Trigger attributes that are $command/^listen attributes.
  
  Examples:
    > @va me=$foo:@emit whee
      Set
    > @tr/quiet/command me/va
      whee
  
  See Also: LOOPING, u(), @include
  
& @unlink
  Command: @unlink <room/exit>
  This command removes drop-tos on rooms and clears the destination on exits.
  Once unlinked, an exit may be taken over by anyone with the @link command.
  
  See Also: @link, LINKING, @destroy
  
& @unlock
  Command: @unlock[/<whichlock>] <object>
           @unlock <object>/<attrib>
  
  The first form removes the lock on <object>, so that anyone may pass
  through (if an exit) or pick it up (if a player or an object).
  
  The second form clears the locked flag on the indicated attribute of the
  named object.  This allows the attribute to change ownership to the new
  owner automatically when the object is @chowned, and allows the owner
  of the object to @chown the attribute to itself or to overwrite it.
  You must own the attribute to be unlocked, but you do not need to own the
  object.  For a listing of locks to use in <whitchlock> please see:
  
         help mail lock   - help on how to remove a mail lock.
         help @lock locks - list of available locks you can @unlock.
  
  See Also: @chown, @lock, ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP
  
& @verb
  Command: @verb <victim>=<actor>,<what>,<def>,<owhat>,<odef>,<awhat>,<args>
 
  This command provides a way to do user-defined verbs with associated
  @attr/@oattr/@aattr groups. Invoking it does the following:
  
  <actor> sees the contents of <victim>'s <what> attribute. The <def> string
  argument is currently ignored.  It served a purpose in a past version
  of @verb, and has been left in to minimize problems with old objects.
  
  Everyone in the same room as <actor> sees the contents of
    <victim>'s <owhat> attribute, with <actor>'s name prepended.
  
  <victim> then executes the contents of his <awhat>
    attribute.
  
  By supplying up to nine <args>, you may pass those values on
  the stack (i.e. %0, %1, %2, etc. up through %9).
 
  You must control the victim, but need not control the actor.
 
{ 'help @verb2' for more }
& @verb2
  Here is a description of the arguments to @verb:
    victim - The object that is searched for attributes, and which runs the
             <awhat> attribute if it is found.
    actor  - The object that 'did' the verb, this is the value for %#/%n/etc
             in substitutions, and this object's name is included in the
             message to others in the same location.
    what   - The name of the attribute containing the message to be delivered
             to the actor.
    whatd  - No purpose now. Left in for compatibility.
    owhat  - The name of the attribute containing the message (prefixed by the
             actor's name) that is sent to everyone in the room with actor.
    owhatd - No purpose now. Left in for compatibility.
    awhat  - The name of the attribute that is to be executed by the victim.
    args   - The comma-separated arguments to be passed for substitution
             (%0-%9).  If there is more than one argument, enclose all the
             arguments within curly braces.  Any argument that contains an
             embedded comma needs to be enclosed in curly braces as well.
 
{ 'help @verb3' for more }
& @verb3
  Examples:
    > &xtest test1=You just tested test1.
    > &oxtest test1=just xtested test1.
    > &axtest test1="I was xtested.  Yikes.  Arg1=%0, Arg2=%1, Arg3=%2.
    > @verb test1=me,xtest,XTEST DFLT,oxtest,OXTEST DFLT,axtest,{a,b c,de}
    You just xtested test1.
    test1 says "I was xtested. Yikes. Arg1=a, Arg2=b c, Arg3=de."
    > &xtest test1
    > &test test1=$test:@verb test1=%n,xtest,nil,oxtest,nil,axtest,{a,b c,de}
    TEST
    You just tested test1.
    test1 says "I was xtested. Yikes. Arg1=a, Arg2=b c, Arg3=de."
  
& @wait
  Command: @wait <seconds>=<command>
           @wait <object>[/<seconds>]=<command>
           @wait/pid <PID>=[+|-]<new seconds>
           @wait/until <real time>=<command>
           @wait <object>[/<real time>]=<command>
           @wait/pid/until <PID>=<real time>
           @wait/recpid <REG> <time>=<command>
           @wait/recpid/until <REG> <real time>=<command>
           @wait/recpid <REG> <object>[/<seconds>]=<command>
  
  The first form of @wait executes <command> after <seconds> seconds.  
  
  The second form increments the semaphore count for <object> and executes
  <command> after <object> is notified with the @notify command.  If the
  semaphore count for <object> is negative (because it has been notified more
  times than it has been waited on), then <command> is run immediately.
  If <seconds> is specified in the second form, the command is automatically
  run after <seconds> seconds even if the semaphore isn't notified.  This
  command charges a deposit of 10 coins, which is refunded when <command>
  is executed.
  
  You may specify miliseconds instead of whole numbers.
  
{ see 'help @wait2' to continue }
  
& @wait2
  Command: -- CONTINUED
           @wait <seconds>=<command>
           @wait <object>[/<seconds>]=<command>
           @wait/pid <PID>=[+|-]<new seconds>
           @wait/until <real time>=<command>
           @wait <object>[/<real time>]=<command>
           @wait/pid/until <PID>=<real time>
           @wait/recpid <REG> <time>=<command>
           @wait/recpid/until <REG> <real time>=<command>
           @wait/recpid <REG> <object>[/<seconds>]=<command>
  
  The third form of @wait will re-specify the seconds of a waited or semaphored
  queue entry.  It does this by referencing the PID of the process that is 
  returned when you do a '@ps'.  You may specify a + or - to increment or 
  decrement the existing time of the wait state.  The total time can't exceed
  the maximum time event (maximum time possible) or be less than 10 seconds
  from the current system clock time.
  
  The /until switch will specify that you want to use a real-time (futurebased)
  instead of a time offset.  This time would be in seconds.
  
  The /recpid switch allows you to specify a register that the PID of the 
  process is stored into.  With this PID, you may then optionally use @notify, 
  @halt, or any other command that recognizes PIDS to handle the queued job.  
  The register can be any of the SETQ registers (0-9 default) that you wish to
  use.
  
  See Also: @drain, @notify, @ps, SEMAPHORES, setq(), setr(), r(), nameq(), 
            pid()
  
& @wipe
  Command: @wipe[/<switch>] <object>[/<wild-attr>]
 
  This command erases attributes from an object.  All attributes that match
  <wild-attr> (or all attributes, if <wild-attr> is not specified) are removed
  from <object>.  Attributes that you do not have permission to modify (such
  as read-only or locked attributes) are not removed.

  This only works on objects set SAFE if the config options safe_wipe is set
  to 0.
  
  The following switches exist:
    /preserve    - wipe everything EXCEPT the wild-attr matches.  This in 
                   effect does the reverse of normal @wipe.
    /regexp      - use regular expression instead of standard glob-matching
  
  Example:
    > @wipe me/va*
    Wiped - 1 attributes.
    > @wipe/reg me/^.a$
    Wiped - 4 attributes.
  
  See Also: wipe(), @edit, @grep  

& @whereis
  Command: @whereis <player>
  
  This command will relate to the player the location of the specified player.
  Any player hidden will show to the user that he/she wishes to have privacy
  and their location will not be given.
  
  See Also: @whereall, loc()
  
& @whereall
  Command: @whereall
  
  This command, like @whereis, will show the locations of all connected 
  players not set UNFINDABLE.  Anyone set UNFINDABLE will show that they
  wish to have privacy and their location will not be shown.
  
  See Also: @whereis, loc()
  
& @uptime
  This is an alias for the +uptime command.
  
& @version
  This is an alias for the version command.
  
& +uptime
  Command: +uptime
  
  This command shows how long the mush has been up and the time since 
  the last reboot.
  
  See Also: version
  
& @aahear
  Command: @aahear[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aahear
 
  An Aahear on an object is activated whenever the listen pattern
  matches anything done/said by anything else in the room, including
  itself.  (The Ahear ignores itself, helpful for keeping machines from 
  triggering itself).  
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @aahear listener = "I heard someone (maybe me?) say the word!
   
  See Also: @ahear, @amhear, @listen
  
& @aclone
  Command: @aclone[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aclone
 
  Sets the actions to be taken by a new object that has just been created
  as the result of a @clone command.  The contents of the Aclone attribute
  are run by the new object and not by the old object.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @aclone Time bomb = @wait 600=@trig me/va;@wait 10=@trig me/vb
           @va time bomb = :EXPLODES with a thundering roar;@destroy me
           @vb time bomb = :ticks.; @wait 10=@trig me/vb

  Attribute: Aconnect
 
  Sets the actions to be taken by a player right after connecting to the
  game.  This attribute is only meaningful for players, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  '1' is passed as %0 if you are already connected when you connect, and
  '0' is passed as %0 if it's your only connection.
   
  Example: @aconnect me = check.my.mailbox
  
  See Also: @adisconnect

& @adfail
  Command: @adfail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Adfail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to drop it
  but fails because they didn't pass the object's drop lock.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @adfail sword = @name me=Cursed Sword;:laughs maniacally.
  
  See Also: drop, @dfail, @odfail, @lock
  
& @adisconnect
  Command: @adisconnect[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>

  the game.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  There are three arguments passed to the @adisconnect.
      %0 is the reason for your disconnect (netdeath, quit, logout, etc)
      %1 is the total time in seconds you were connected for that instance.
      %2 is '0' if it's your only connection, '1' if you're connected more 
         than once.

& @aefail
  Command: @aefail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aefail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to enter it
  but fails because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player fails the
  object's enter lock.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to the object or
  teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @aefail car = @emit ;'s alarm starts wailing when %n tries
                         to break in.
  
  See Also: @aenter, @efail, @ealias, @enter, @oefail, @oenter, enter,

  Command: @afail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Afail
 
  Sets the commands to be performed by <object> when one of these events
  occurs:
 
    - For exits: Someone tries to traverse the exit but cannot because they
      fail the exit's default lock or the exit is not linked.
    - For players and things: Someone tries to pick up the object but cannot
      because they fail the object's default lock.
    - For rooms, players, and things: Someone looks around inside the room,
      player, or thing and fails the object's default lock.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example:
    > @afail vase = :falls to the floor and smashes to pieces.;@destroy me
  
  See Also: @fail, @ofail, FAILURE
  
& @agfail
  Command: @agfail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Agfail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to give it
  away but fails because they didn't pass the object's give lock.

& @alfail
  Command: @alfail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Alfail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to leave it
  but fails because the player fails the object's leave lock.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an exit in the
  location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.

  Attribute: Alias
 
  Provides an alternate name by which the player is known.  The alternate
  name is only used for players when referenced as '*<name>' or by commands
  that only take player names (such as page or @stats).  You may not set
  an alias on any other object type.
 
  When setting an alias, the alias is checked to see that it is both a legal
  player name and not already in use.  Only if both checks succeed is the
  alias set.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  See Also: @name, @protect, listprotection()
  
& @amhear
  Command: @amhear[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Amhear
 
  Sets the actions to be taken after the object hears a string that matches
  the pattern in the Listen attribute which was produced by the object
  itself.
  Messages that are produced by anything other than the object itself are

  location to another, whether by using an exit, entering or leaving an
  object, teleporting, or going home.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, and things and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @amove car = @vz me=[extract(%vz,1,19)] [loc(me)]
  
  See Also: @move, @omove
  
& @ansiname
  Command: @ansiname[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: AnsiName
  
  This sets the ansi codes for the particular object.  As long as that object
  is allowed to have ansi codes (individually or globally) then whatever
  color codes you put in @ansiname will be the color of the name of the
  object.  
  
  This only will effect looking, inventory, and contents.  
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  If you wish pose, say, and @wall to ansifi your name, set the VARIABLE
  @toggle on yourself.
  
  Example: 
    > @ansiname object=hr
    Set.
  
  Note:  If the object is @toggled with EXTANSI, then ansiname can hold
         literal ansicodes.  Check help on @extansi for this.  
  
  See Also: @name, @extansi, @caption, ANSINAME, ansi(), EXTANSI TOGGLE, 
            @titlecaption

& @moniker
  There is no @moniker.  You actually want @extansi.
  
  If you wish pose, say, and @wall to ansifi your name, set the VARIABLE
  @toggle on yourself.
  
  Please see help on @extansi on how to utilize this.
  
  See Also: @ansiname, @titlecaption, ANSINAME, ansi(), EXTANSI TOGGLE,
            @extansi, @caption  
  
& @extansi
  Command: @extansi[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  
  The @extansi command allows you to set multi-color names for an item.  This
  only effects contents, inventories, and the normal 'look'.  It will not
  effect anything else.  In addition, the name in @extansi MUST match the
  name returned by name() (minus ansi codes).  
  i.e.  stripansi(get(object/ansiname)) = name(object)
  
  @extansi is stored in the @ansiname attribute.  This will, naturally, 
  overwrite the previous @ansiname ansi color you may have used.
  
  Note:  Target must be @toggled EXTANSI to use this command.
  
  The optional switch /quiet suppresses output unless an error is thrown.
  
  If you wish pose, say, and @wall to ansifi your name, set the VARIABLE
  @toggle on yourself.
  
  Examlple:  @name object=99 Red Balloons
             > Name set.
             @extansi object=99 [ansi(hr,Red)] Baboons
             > String entered must match name of target, 99 Red Balloons.
             @extansi object=99 [ansi(hr,Red)] Balloons
             > Ansi string entered for 99 Red Balloons of '99 Red Balloons'.
  
  See Also: @ansiname, @name, ansi(), EXTANSI TOGGLE
  
& @apay
  Command: @apay[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Apay
 
  Sets the actions to be taken after the object is given the number of coins
  specified in its Cost attribute.  If the giver tries to give more than that
  number of coins, the excess is refunded, and if less than the necessary
  amount is given then it is all given back and a snide message is sent to
  the giver.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.

  Example: @ause grenade = :EXPLODES with a thundering roar; kill %n=100;
                           @destroy me
  See Also: use, @ouse, @use
  
& @away
  Command: @away[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Away
 
  This attribute is sent as a message to anyone who tries to page you when 
  you are not connected. %# is used for the person paging you and not you
  yourself.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players, and will never be
  automatically referenced on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @away me = Hey, I'm not even connected.  So why are you paging me?
  
  See Also: @idle, @reject, page
  
& @nameformat
  Command: @nameformat[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: NameFormat
  
  This attribute allows a user to define a user-presentable way for names.
  This replaces the normal name of the target when viewed from the INSIDE.
  Thus, this only has effects for rooms, and for objects only when you are
  inside them.  This is meaningless for exits and players.
  
  Examples:
    > look
    A big Room
    You see before you a big room.
    Contents:
    The Goat
    > @nameformat here=[name(me)] (I think?)
    > look
    A big Room (I think?)
    You see before you a big room.
    Contents:
    The Goat
   
  The mush has to be configured to enable this to work.  '@list options'
  
  See Also: @exitformat, @conformat
  
& @conformat
  Command: @conformat[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: ConFormat
  
  This attribute allows a user to define a user-presentable way for contents.
  This replaces the normal 'Contents:' and 'Carrying:' lists.  The variable
  is evaluated as it would a description or other similiar message.
  
  Examples:
    > look
    A big Room
    You see before you a big room.
    Contents:
    The Goat
    > @conformat here=Room Contents:[iter(lcon(me),%r---> [name(##)])]
    > look
    A big Room
    You see before you a big room.
    Room Contents:
    ---> The Goat
   
  The mush has to be configured to enable this to work.  '@list options'
  
  See Also: @exitformat, @nameformat
  
& @exitformat
  Command: @exitformat[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: ExitFormat
  
  This attribute allows a user to define a user-presentable way for exits.
  This replaces the normal 'Obvious exits:'  listing.  The variable is
  evaluated as it would a description or other similiar message.
  
  Examples:
    > look
    A big Room
    You see before you a big room.
    Obvious exits:
    Out <O>  Bedroom <B>
    > @exitformat here=Room Exits:[iter(lexits(me),%r#@. [name(##)])]
    > look
    A big Room
    You see before you a big room.
    Room Exits:
    1. Out <O>
    2. Bedroom <B>
  
  The mush has to be configured to enable this to work.  '@list options'
  
  See Also: @conformat, @nameformat
  
& @exitto
  Command: @exitto[/<switch>] <exit> = <string>
  Attribute: ExitTo
  
  This attribute allows an exit to handle 'Variable Exits'.  In essence,
  this attribute is parsed then is checked for a valid linkable destination
  to send the target who enters the exit to.  All exit messages are 
  evaluated and sent as well.
  
  Example:
    > @toggle MyExit=variable
    Set.
    > @exitto MyExit=[switch(obj(%#),he,#123,she,#234,#567)]
    Set.
  
  The above example sends all people of a male sex to room #123, female to 
  #234, and anyone who doesn't match either to #567.
  
  See Also: variable exits, variable toggle
  
& @caption
  Command: @caption[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: Caption
  
  This attribute sets up a caption that is used when a player is looked at.
  This 'caption' is appended to their name.  You may set a large caption,
  but only the first 40 characters will be used.  ANSI is also stripped.
  This is only used for players and is ignored for every other data type.
  
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
  
  Example: 
    > lo me
    Tinyplayer(#123Pc)
    You see nothing special.
    > @caption me=the silly one.
    > lo me
    Tinyplayer(#123Pc), the silly one.
    You see nothing special.
    > @set me=myopic
    > lo me
    Tinyplayer, the silly one.
    You see nothing special.
  
  See Also: @ansiname, @extansi, @name, @titlecaption

& @titlecaption
  Command: @titlecaption[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: Title_Name
  
  This attribute sets up a title (prefix) for the target player when
  they are looked at or looked at in a given location.  You may set
  a large title, but only the first 40 characters will be displayed.
  No carrage returns are allowed in this string and it is only useful
  for players.
  
  Example:
    > lo me
    Tinyplayer(#123Pc)
    You see nothing special.
    > @titlecaption me=Doctor
    > lo me
    Doctor Tinyplayer(#123Pc)
    You see nothing special.
  
  See Also: @ansiname, @extansi, @name, @caption

& @charges
  Command: @charges[/<switch>] <object> = <count>
  Attribute: Charges
 
  This attribute allows you to limit the number of times an object can be
  used.  If there is a charges attribute it is decremented each time an
  action on the object is triggered.  Once it reaches zero, normal triggering
  stops and the Runout attribute (if one is present) is run instead.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @charges Fireball wand = 5
  
  See Also: @runout
  
& @cost
  Command: @cost[/<switch>] <object> = <amount>
  Attribute: Cost
 
  Sets the number of coins that need to be given to an object to trigger the
  Pay, Opay, and Apay attributes.  If the object is given more than this
  amount, the excess is returned to the giver, while if less than this amount
  is given the entire amount is returned, a snide message is sent to the
  giver, and the Apay, Opay, and Pay attributes are not used.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @cost Coke machine = 25
  
  See Also: give, @apay, @opay, @pay
  
& @describe
  Command: @describe[/<switch>] <object> = <description>
  Attribute: Desc
 
  Sets the description for <object>, which others see when they look at the
  object.  Giving all your objects, rooms, and exits good descriptions is
  considered to be good building practice.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in descriptions, and
  are evaluated when someone looks at the object.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the object being looked at, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the looker.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Examples:
    <object> @desc vase = You see a delicate Ming vase.
    <exit>   @desc elevator = There is an elevator to the east.
  
  See Also: look, @adescribe, @odescribe, listen, @slisten, touch, @stouch, 
            taste, @staste, smell, @ssmell
  
& @dfail
  Command: @dfail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Dfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to drop the object but
  fails because he didn't pass the object's drop lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In function
  references, 'me' refers to the object being dropped, while %-substitutions
  that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @dfail sword = The sword has welded itself to your hand.
  
  See Also: drop, @adfail, @odfail, @lock
  
& @DOOR
  Command : @DOOR 
  Switches: STATUS, OPEN, CLOSED, LIST
  
  @DOOR provides control over arbitraty TCP connections that are opened from
  inside the mush to some external program or service.
  
  In order for a door to be available a C-code module must first be loaded by
  an Admin(*), or compiled statically into the mush server.
  
  To see what doors exist on your system, type: @DOOR
  
  (*) Not available in RhostMUSH 3.2.4p15
  
  See Also: DOOR_OPEN, DOOR_CLOSE, DOOR_LIST, DOOR_STATUS, DOOR_WRITING,
            INTERNAL_DOORS, DOORED
  
& DOOR_LIST
  Command : @DOOR/LIST <name>
  
  This command lists information with regards to which doors are configured
  on this system.
  
  @DOOR/LIST without any arguments will return the same as just typing @DOOR.
  @DOOR/LIST name will return information for the named door only.

    NUM  NAME       STATUS      P  LOC
   (# 0) MUSH       OFFLINE    (0) #PLAYER
  
  The above is an example of information returned by @DOOR/LIST.
  -  The number is the internal identifier for the given door-type.
  -  The STATUS will be one of OFFLINE, ONLINE, CLOSED, OPEN, INTERNAL
  -  'P' stands for 'permission' and means that you must have a bittype()
     of at least this high to use or see the door.
  -  'LOC' will be one of #PLAYER, #ROOM, #EXIT, #THING, #<DBREF>.
     If #PLAYER, then any player matching the required permission may open
     this door.
     If #ROOM, then any room that matches the required permission can trigger
     this door upon a player. #EXIT and #THING work in a similar way.
     If the value is a dbref then only the specified dbref can access the door
  
  See Also: @DOOR, DOOR_OPEN, DOOR_CLOSE, DOOR_STATUS, DOOR_WRITING,
            INTERNAL_DOORS, DOORED, BITTYPE()
  
& DOOR_OPEN
  Command : @DOOR/OPEN <name> [ = arguments ]
  
  Use this command to open a connection to a named door. The door's status
  must be set to 'ONLINE' or already be 'OPEN' for this to work.
  
  Certain doors may require additional arguments before they can be opened.
  
  In addition some doors may have bitlevel requirements or may only be 
  triggered by certain people, rooms, or exits. Check @DOOR/LIST for details.

            INTERNAL_DOORS, DOORED, BITTYPE()
  
& DOOR_CLOSE
  Command : @DOOR/CLOSE <name>
  
  This command will close an existing door connection providing it's 
  currently open.
  
  If you're caught in a door and need to abort it then type:
  > !@DOOR/CLOSE <name>

& DOOR_STATUS
  Command : @DOOR/STATUS <name> = <status>
  Note    : This switch is restricted to immortals only.
  
  Used to change the status of a door. Valid statuses are ONLINE, OFFLINE, and
  CLOSED. If CLOSED or OFFLINE is chosen then all existing connections are
  terminated.

  API Version: 0.2
  
  The following is meant as a quick-guide to writing your own door modules.
  Examples and even the API may change after the writing of this document, and
  can be found by looked at http://lensman.the-wyvern.net/rhost/doors.html
  
  The door API is meant to be an easy to use way by which new doors can be
  created and plugged into the Mush.
  
  In essence only one function -MUST- be written, although for most doors up
  to 5 may need to be provided.
  
  The functions will be detailed on the next page. See DOOR_WRITING2
   
& DOOR_WRITING2
  These functions are defined as:
    typedef void (*doorInit_t)   (void);
    typedef void (*doorOpen_t)   (DESC *d, int nargs, char *cargs[], int id);
    typedef void (*doorClose_t)  (DESC *d);
    typedef void (*doorOutput_t) (DESC *d, char *pText);
    typedef void (*doorInput_t)  (DESC *d, char *pText);
  
  doorInit is called when the door is first registered with the mush.
  doorOpen is called when a request is made to open the door.
  doorClose is called when a request is made to close the door.
  doorOutput: Output is defined as text going from the mush through the door.
              As such this function is called when the user inputs some text
              that needs sending over through the door.
  doorInput : Input is defined as text going from the door through to the 
              mush.  As such this function is called when information comes 
              through the door for the player.
  
  See DOOR_WRITING3
  
& DOOR_WRITING3
  Once the functions are written to the above interface, they are registered
  with the mush by adding the following line to the end of door.c within the
  registerDoors function.
  
  addDoor(<name>, initFunc, openFunc, closeFunc, inputFunc, outputFunc, P, L);
  
  *Func should be the name of your implementation function. P is the 
  permission, or bittype level, at which this door should be usable. And L 
  should be one of PLAYER_e, ROOM_e, EXIT_e, or dbref. It corresponds to the
  LOC field on @DOOR/LIST
  
  initFunc, closeFunc, inputFunc and outputFunc may all be null. If the 
  inputFunc and/or outputFunc is null then the mush will simply pass bytes 
  back and forth between the door and the player. This is most suited for a 
  'telnet' style protocol.
  
  For examples of door code, take a look at door_mush.c and door_mail.c, 
  included with your RhostMUSH.
  
& INTERNAL_DOORS
  Internal Doors are special cases of @DOORs. They will can only be seen on 
  the active door list by immortals, and cannot be accessed via the @DOOR 
  command.
  
  Typically Internal Doors are used transparently by other aspects of the 
  MUSH.  For example, the Rhost MCP module relies on the use of internal 
  doors as follows.
    - When the MUSH is started, the MCP door is registered with the door code 
      and a connection established to the MCP server.
    - On the initialization of the door, new commands are also registered 
      within the MUSH command parser; @mcom, @mwho, @mcode. When a player 
      invokes one of the MCP commands, his input it parsed by the MCP door 
      code and sent out across the ether, likewise if a message comes back 
      through the door it is parsed and passed on to the correct player(s).
  
  Expect to see alot more happening in this area soon! :)

& @drop
  Command: @drop[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Drop
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he drops the object, or after he
  goes through the exit.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop messages, and
  are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the object being dropped, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Examples: <object> @drop vase = You gently put down the delicate vase.
            <exit>   @drop elevator = The elevator doors close behind you.
  
  See Also: drop, @adrop, @odrop, DROP-TO, EXITS
  
& @ealias
  Command: @ealias[/<switch>] <object> = <entrance-list>
  Attribute: Ealias
 
  Sets up a set of alternate commands that may be used as synonyms for the
  command 'enter <object>' when you are in the same location as the object.
  The alternate commands are separated by semicolons just like in exit names.
 
  Entry aliases are checked for after exitnames, built-in MUSH commands, and
  leave aliases for the current location, but before $-commands.  If more than
  one object has an entry alias that matches a player's command, the one on
  the object that occurs first in the location contents list is used.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically looked at on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @ealias car = get in car; car; climb in; go for a ride
  
  See Also: @lalias, enter, leave
  
& @efail
  Command: @efail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Efail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to enter the object but
  fails because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player fails the
  object's enter lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in efail messages, and
  are evaluated when someone fails to enter the object.  In function
  references, 'me' refers to the object that the enactor tried to enter, while
  %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to
  the player who tried (and failed) to enter.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to the object or
  teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @efail car = The car's door is locked.
  
  See Also: @aefail, @aenter, @ealias, @enter, @oefail, @oenter, enter,
            ENTER_OK
  
& @enter
  Command: @enter[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Enter
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when entering an object or room,
  whether by using an exit, the enter or leave commands, or by teleporting.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in enter messages, and
  are evaluated when someone enters the object.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the object being entered, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the player entering the
  object.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and will never
  be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @enter car = You climb into the car and buckle your seatbelt.
  
  See Also: enter, @aenter, @oenter, ENTER_OK
  
& @fail
  Command: @fail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Fail
 
  Sets the failure message for <object>.  This message is seen by the actor
  when one of these events occurs:
 
    - For exits: Someone tries to traverse the exit but cannot because they
      fail the exit's default lock or the exit is not linked.
    - For players and things: Someone tries to pick up the object but cannot
      because they fail the object's default lock.
    - For rooms, players, and things: Someone looks around inside the room,
      player, or thing and fails the object's default lock.
 
  Substitution and evaluation is performed on the message before it is shown.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example:
    > @fail table = It's too heavy to lift!                            <thing>
    > @fail doorway = The doorknob does not turn.                       <exit>
  
  See Also: get, @afail, @ofail, FAILURE
  
& @filter
  Command: @filter[/<switch>] <object> = <pattern>[, <pattern>...]
  Attribute: Filter
 
  This attribute specifies a series of patterns to be used to suppress
  text normally forwarded by the AUDIBLE flag.  If the desired pattern
  contains a comma, the pattern may be enclosed in curly braces {}.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example:
    > @fo test=out
    > @set #378=puppet
    test> test grows ears and can now hear.
    > @filter out = {* has arrived.},{* has left.}
    Set.
    > :has not arrived.
    Wizard has not arrived.
    test> From a distance, Wizard has not arrived.
    > :has arrived.
    Wizard has arrived.
  
  See Also:  AUDIBLE, @forwardlist, @infilter, @inprefix, @prefix
  
& @forwardlist
  Command: @forwardlist[/<switch>] <object> = <dbref-list>
  Attribute: Forwardlist
 
  Specifies a list of locations (specified by their db numbers) that are to
  receive messages heard by <object> (filtered by the @filter attribute and
  prefixed by the @prefix attribute).  The messages are only forwarded if
  <object> has its AUDIBLE flag set.
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
   
  See Also: @filter, @prefix, AUDIBLE
  
& @gfail
  Command: @gfail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Gfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to give away the object
  but fails because he didn't pass the object's give lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in give failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give away the object.
  In function references, 'me' refers to the object being given away, while
  %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer
  to the (attempted) giver.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @gfail sword = You can't give away a cursed sword!
  
  See Also: give, @agfail, @ogfail, @lock
  
& @idesc
  Command: @idesc[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Idesc
 
  Sets the internal description for <object>.  The internal description of an
  object will be shown to any player entering it.  If not set, the regular
  description in the Desc attribute is shown instead.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in inside descriptions,
  and are evaluated when someone fails to get or look at the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being looked at, while
  %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc)
  refer to the player doing the looking.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @idesc car = You are sitting in the driver's seat of a Volkswagen
                        Beetle.
  
  See Also: enter, @describe, ENTER_OK
  
& @idle
  Command: @idle[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Idle
 
  This attribute is sent as a message to anyone who successfully pages you.
  It can be used to tell someone who pages you when you will return
  (if you are going to be away for a while).  %# is used for the person
  who pages you and not you yourself.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players, and will never be
  automatically referenced on other object types.
  
  The attribute will not be displayed if it returns an empty string.
  Idea borrowed from PENN.
   
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @idle me = At dinner.  Back about 7PM.
           @idle me = [ifelse(gt(idle(me),600),Away from computer.  Idle)]
  
  The second example will only display an idle message if you've been idle over
  10 minutes.
  
  See Also: @away, @reject, page
  
& @sudo
  Command: @sudo[</switch>] <target>=<command>
  
  The @sudo allows you to execute a command through the target. This is
  done through the normal command processor and while similiar permissions
  to @force, does not suffer from the queue delay.  You can not @sudo to
  something you have no control over.  @sudo performs the action according
  to the target's viewpoint, including location. @sudo only works on a single
  command.  If you wish to @sudo multiple commands, use in junction with
  @include.  By default, all registers altered during the @sudo are considered
  local.
  
  Available switches:
    /globalize -- treat registers to target as non-localized.  Dangerous.
    /clearregs -- clear the registers of the default localized registers.
  
  Examples:
    > @sudo *player=say boo
    Player says "boo"
    > @va *player=say boo;say baa
    > @sudo *player=@include me/va  (notice it triggers @va based on target)
    Player says "boo"
    Player says "baa"
  
  See Also: @include, @force, @trigger, @skip 
  
& @if
& @ifelse
& @skip
  Command: @skip <boolean expression>=<command>
           @skip/ifelse <boolean expression>=<true command>[,<false command>]
  
  The @skip command 'skips' the command from being executed if the boolean 
  logic presented to @skip is true.  The command will be processed in the
  normal queue and not executed out of order.  Any value other than '0'
  is considered 'true' and not a true boolean.  This only processes a single
  command.  If multiple commands are required, please use @include.
  
  Notice if you specify the /ifelse switch the condition is reversed to match
  how a normal if-else statement would work.  @skip/ifelse is aliased to
  @if and @ifelse.
  
  Examples:
    > @wait 0={think 1;think 2;@skip 0=think 3;think 4}
    1
    2
    3
    4
    > @wait 0={think 1;think 2;@skip 1=think 3;think 4}
    1
    2

& @attach
& @include
  Command: @include[/<switch>] <object>/<attr> [=<arg1>,<arg2>,...,<argN>]
           @attach[/<switch>]  <object>/<attr> [=<arg1>,<arg2>,...,<argN>]
  
  Note:  @attach is an alias to @include/override.
  
  The @include command can only be issued in a queue.  Ergo, if it is to be 
  issued at the player command line, it must be queued first (like with @wait)
  
  The @include command will insert, at the location of the @include, any 
  commands that were stored in the specified attribute on the specified 
  object.  You must have control over the object and be able to see the
  attribute to be able to fetch the information.  This passes all the standard
  arguments (%0-%9) and can be overridden by arguments you pass to it.  After
  the @included text, the %0-%9 variables will return to what it was prior
  to the @include.
  
  This behaves similar to @trigger, except it will insert the commands in
  order and not queue them up.
  
  @include honors @break/@assert.  You can have at most 10 @includes.  You
  can only nest to 3 levels deep.
  
  @admin params includecnt and includenest handle @include's flexibility.
  
  The following switches exist for @include:
    /command   - bypass the $command/^listen portion of the attribute.
    /clearregs - clear the registers prior to calling included attribute.
                 Note: this automatically sets the localize option.
    /localize  - localizes the registers for the include duration.
    /nobreak   - disregard @break/@assert inside the includes from outside.
    /target    - Use the target as executor instead of executor of @include
                 Note: You must control target to use this.
    /override  - If any arguments are passed to @include to override the
                 default, this will disable all default arguments.
    
  {see @include2 for examples}

& @infilter
  Command: @infilter[/<switch>] <object> = <pattern>[, <pattern>...]
  Attribute: Infilter
 
  This attribute specifies a series of patterns to be used to suppress
  text normally sent to the contents of <object> by @listen.  If the desired
  pattern contains a comma, the pattern may be enclosed in curly braces {}.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example:
    > @listen sports car=*
    > @fo test=enter sports car
    test has left.
    test> Sports Car(#383Q)
    > :waves.
    test> Wizard waves.
    Wizard waves.
    > @infilter sports = *waves*
    > :waves.

  See Also: @filter, @inprefix, @listen, @prefix
  
& @inprefix
  Command: @inprefix[/<switch>] <object> = <prefix text>
  Attribute: Inprefix
 
  This attribute, when set, will prefix all text that is sent to the contents
  of <object> by @listen.  The default is to have no prefix, the text is
  forwarded unadorned.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example:
    > @listen sports car=*
    > @fo test=enter sports car
    test has left.
    test> Sports Car(#383Q)
    > :waves.
    test> Wizard waves.
    Wizard waves.
    > @inprefix sports car = In the mundane world outside,
    test> In the mundane world outside, Wizard waves some more.
    Wizard waves some more.
  
  See Also: @filter, @infilter, @listen, @prefix
  
& @kill
  Command: @kill[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Kill
 
  This command sets the message that is shown to anyone who kills <object>.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in kill messages, and
  are evaluated when someone kills the object.  In function references, 'me'
  refers to the object that was killed, while %-substitutions that refer to
  the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the player doing the killing.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @kill guard = The guard says "I'll get.. you... for... this... %n"
                         as he falls down and dies.
  
  See Also: kill, @akill, @okill, BEING KILLED, IMMORTAL, ROYALTY
  
& @Lalias
  Command: @lalias[/<switch>] <object> = <entrance-list>
  Attribute: Lalias
 
  Sets up a set of alternate commands that may be used as synonyms for the
  command 'leave' when you are inside a player or a thing.  The alternate
  commands are separated by semicolons just like in exit names.
 
  Leave aliases are checked for after exitnames and built-in MUSH commands, but
  before enter aliases and $-commands.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically looked at on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @lalias car = get out;climb out;out;open door;outside
  
  See Also: @ealias, enter, leave
  
& @leave
  Command: @leave[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Leave
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when leaving an object or room, whether
  by using an exit, the enter or leave commands, or by teleporting.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in leave messages, and
  are evaluated when someone leaves the object.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the object being left, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the player leaving the
  object.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and will never
  be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @leave car = You unbuckle your seatbelt and climb out of the car.
  
  See Also: leave, @aleave, @oleave
  
& @lfail
  Command: @lfail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Lfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to leave it but fails
  because the player fails the object's leave lock.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an exit in the
  location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @lfail plane = You don't have a parachute!
  
  See Also: @aleave, @alfail, @lalias, @leave, @oleave, @olfail, leave
  
& @lfunction
  Command: @lfunction[/<switches>] [<function>] [=<object>/<attr> | <value>]
   
  This command creates a localized function named <function>.  A localized
  function is only seen by the owner of the target and all things owned by
  that target.  Function existance is checked by the object doing the 
  execution of the code, thereby allowing owners the ability to use their
  own functions in their own code without worry of cross-funtion evaluation.

  When invoked, the arguments to the function are loaded into %0-%9, 
  the <attr> attribute from <object> is fetched, and substitution is 
  performed on the resulting text.  The result of that substitution is 
  returned as the function result.
  
  You may only have 20 localized functions defined.
  
  The following switches exist:
    /privilege  - the function is evaluated as if the evaluation were being 
                  performed by the object on which it is stored, instead of 
                  as if it were being performed by the invoker of the function.
    /list       - list all current softcoded functions (with dbref#/attr's)
    /preserve   - the function preserves setq registers (r(0)-r(9)).
    /delete     - delete the specified user-defined function.
    /display    - displays the details of the specified function.
    /protect    - all setq registers called in a localized function are nulled.
    /notrace    - the specified function when defined can't be TRACEed.
    /max        - Set the maximum number of arguments for the function.
                  The default is '-1' or unlimited.
    /min        - Set the minimum number of arguments for the function.
                  The default is '-1' or 0.
  
  {see 'help @lfunction2' to continue}

& @lfunction2
  Command: @lfunction[/<switches>] [<function>] [=<object>/<attr>]
  
  The function definitions created by @lfunction are not stored in the database
  so they need to be re-created each time the RhostMUSH is started.  It is
  recommended that the Startup attribute for the target include code to set up
  all global functions.  The privalaged and preserved, protect, and notrace 
  switches may be combined.
   
  All global functions have precedence over local functions.  All built-in
  functions have priority over all other functions (unless overridden).
  Listing local functions will only display the functions that you have
  control over, meaning wizards will see all local functions defined and
  the owners of those functions.
  
  Examples:  @lfunction myfunction=#123/myattribute
             @lfunction/priv/pres myfunction=#123/myattribute
             @lfunction/priv/pres/prot myfunction=#123/myattribute
             @lfunction/priv/pres/prot/notrace myfunction=#123/myattribute
             @lfunction/list
             @lfunction/display myfunction
             @lfunction/delete myfunction
             @lfunction/delete #12_myfunction (delete myfunction of user #12)
             @lfunction/max myfunction=5
             @lfunction/min myfunction=3
  
  Note: With the /list switch, the following letters represent the following:
             W - privalaged
             p - preserved
             + - protected
             t - notrace
  
  You will see the MAX and MIN fields only if they are outside the defaults. 
  
  When deleting functions, if you wish to specify a local function that is
  by a specific user, you may use the form:
     @lfunction/del <dbref>_<function>
  
  Example:
     > @function/del #12345_myfunction
  
  See Also: u(), streval(), eval()
 
& @listen
  Command: @listen[/<switch>] <object> = <string>
  Attribute: Listen
 
  This attribute contains a wildcard pattern that the object listens for.
  Anything spoken, posed, emitted, or whispered in the room that <object> is
  in, as well as messages resulting from using objects (such as Opay and Succ
  messages) are checked against the Listen attribute.  When the object hears 
  something that matches the pattern, it triggers the Ahear attribute, as
  well as either the Amhear or Aahear attributes, as appropriate,
  substituting %0 the string that matched the first wildcard character in the
  Listen, %1 for the second. etc.  If the pattern in the Listen attribute is
  matched, objects in <object>'s inventory will also hear the message and
  have a chance to match it.  Objects whose Listen attribute is set to
  anything will be listed when a @sweep command is run by someone in the
  same room.
 
  If the @listen pattern is matched, then the object's contents will
  hear the message also, prefixed by the text in @inprefix if it is set.  Any
  text that matches any pattern specified in @infilter will not be sent to
  the contents.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @listen camera = * has arrived.
           @ahear camera = @va me = %va %0
  
  See Also: @aahear, @ahear, @amhear, @sweep, @inprefix, @infilter
  
& @move
  Command: @move[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Move
 
  Sets the message that an object sees after it moves from one location to
  another, whether by using an exit, entering or leaving an object,
  teleporting, or going home.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, and things and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @move bopper = OK.  You're there now.
  
  See Also: @amove, @omove
  
& @odescribe
  Command: @odescribe[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Odesc

  Command: @odfail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Odfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to others in
  the same room when someone tries to drop <object> but fails because they
  didn't pass the object's drop lock.  if the message evaluates to null,
  nothing is displayed.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In function
  references, 'me' refers to the object being dropped, while %-substitutions
  that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @odfail sword = tries to put down the sword but it leaps back
                                       into %p hand.
  
  See Also: drop, @adfail, @dfail, @lock
  
& @odrop
  Command: @odrop[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Odrop
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to others in
  the room when someone drops <object>, or to others in the room that the

& @oefail
  Command: @oefail[/<switch>] <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Oefail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to others in
  the same room as the player when he tries to enter the object but fails
  because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player fails the
  object's enter lock.  if the message evaluates to null, nothing is displayed.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to the object or
  teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @oefail car = tries to open the car's door, but it is locked.
  
  See Also: @aefail, @aenter, @ealias, @efail, @enter, @oenter, enter,

  Command: @oenter[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Oenter
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to others in
  the location being entered when someone enters <object>.  Note that the
  message is shown to those inside the object, not those outside.

  See Also: enter, @aenter, @enter, @oxenter
  
& @ofail
  Command: @ofail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Ofail
 
  Sets the others failure message for <object>.  This message is seen others
  in the same location as the actor when one of these events occurs:
 
    - For exits: Someone tries to traverse the exit but cannot because they
      fail the exit's default lock or the exit is not linked.
    - For players and things: Someone tries to pick up the object but cannot
      because they fail the object's default lock.
    - For rooms, players, and things: Someone looks around inside the room,
      player, or thing and fails the object's default lock.
 
  Substitution and evaluation is performed on the message before it is shown.
  If the message evaluates to null, nothing is displayed.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Examples:
    > @ofail table = tries to pick up the table, but it is too heavy.  <thing>
    > @ofail doorway = tries the knob on the door, to no avail.         <exit>

  Command: @ogfail[/<switch>] <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Ogfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to others in
  the same room when someone tries to give away <object> but fails because
  they didn't pass the object's give lock.  If the message evaluates to null,
  nothing is displayed.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in give failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give away the object.
  In function references, 'me' refers to the object being given away, while

  the same room as the player when he tries to leave it but fails because the
  player fails the object's leave lock.  If the message evaluates to null,
  nothing is displayed.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set via
  the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an exit in the
  location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give

  When a player teleports another object (@tel <object>=<destination>), the
  lock is checked against the player, not the object.
 
  Optional switches are /quiet to suppress output or /noisy to give 
  verbose output.
 
  Example: @otfail here = thinks about teleporting to the Magic Room, but
                          decides against it at the last moment.

  or exits.  
  
  If the config blind_snuffs_cons is enabled, this will also snuff
  the connect and disconnect messages.
  
  Note:  If the RhostMUSH is configured to make the BLIND flag 
         always in effect, then the BLIND flag will do the reverse
         of it's normal behavior, and make exit movement visible.
         @list options to see if it's in effect or not.
  
  See Also: CLOAK, DARK, UNFINDABLE
  
& SHOWFAILCMD
  Flag: SHOWFAILCMD([f])  
  
  This flag, when set on an item, will return the 
  appropiate @ufail messages (ufail, aufail, oufail), if there is a
  matching $command and the object is uselocked against you.
  
& BOUNCE
& BOUNCEFORWARD
  Flag: BOUNCE([o])  
  Attribute: BOUNCEFORWARD
  
  Note:  The attribute is set with @set or &.
  
  This flag redirects the output that the target receives
  and sends it to all of it's contents.  This is handy if you don't want
  to mess with @listens or @forwards.  This allows players to have 
  'listens' without having to enable 'player_listen' which can be 
  dangerous.
  
  The target set BOUNCE may have a BOUNCEFORWARD attribute that will
  redirect everything that object would have seen to the list of
  dbref#'s specified in BOUNCEFORWARD.  The list must be dref#'s
  and valid player objects.  Be aware that the source forwarding
  notifies the targets in the BOUNCEFORWARD where the text is
  originating from, so no abusing it :)
  
  Examples:
    > @set thing=bounce
    Set.
    > &bounceforward thing=#12 #34 #4567
    Set.
  
& MARKER0
  Flag: MARKER0([0])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER1
  Flag: MARKER1([1])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag. 
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER2
  Flag: MARKER2([2])
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER3
  Flag: MARKER3([3])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER4
  Flag: MARKER4([4])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER5
  Flag: MARKER5([5])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER6
  Flag: MARKER6([6])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER7
  Flag: MARKER7([7])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER8
  Flag: MARKER8([8])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& MARKER9
  Flag: MARKER9([9])  
  
  This flag is a marker flag.  
  By default only #1 may set or unset it.  To change permissions
  of this flag, use the @flagdef command (in wizhelp).
  
& BYEROOM
  Flag: BYEROOM(=)  
  
  This flag, when set on rooms, is meant to depict that your
  room is about to be destroyed.  This is used instead of the GOING 
  flag as the server has been heavily modified and now will allow
  for one thing the recovery of destroyed players/rooms/things under
  a set period of time.  The syntax is @set #room=!BYEROOM
  
  See Also: GOING, @destroy
  
& COUNCILOR
  Flag: COUNCILOR(a)  
  
  This flag, when set on players, will allow them most
  wizard powers and the ability to effect anything equal to or less
  in power.  They can basically effect anything within their power
  by #<object> or *<player>.  Only ROYALTY or SUPER-ROYALTY can
  set or unset this flag.
  
  See Also: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, ROYALTY, IMMORTAL
  
& CHOWN_OK
  Flag: CHOWN_OK(C)
  
  This flag, when set, allows you to transfer ownership to
  another player. To set it, you must be carrying the object. You 
  also have to be in the room if you want to set this flag on rooms 
  or exits.  After this flag is set, the new player may gain 
  ownership of the object by using the @chown command (See @chown).
  
  See Also: @chown
  
& CONNECTED
  Flag: CONNECTED(c)   
  
  This flag applies only to players and it shows if the 
  player is connected or not. Thus, each time you are connected to 
  the game, you should see the 'c' flag set, otherwise, you are DEAD!
  You cannot reset this flag, and it is used internally by the code 
  for things like tabulating players for the WHO list, etc.
  
& DARK
  Flag: DARK(D)   
  
  If a room is DARK, then no items are shown when a person 
  'looks' there. If a thing is DARK, then "look" does not list that 
  object in the room's Contents:, and if an exit is DARK, it doesn't 
  show up in the Obvious Exits: list.  Puppets and objects that can 
  listen cannot be DARK.
  
  The RhostMUSH default however, allows puppets and listening devices
  to be dark as well as players.  However, on players, DARK does not
  hide them from the WHO listing.  Use the UNFINDABLE flag for this.
  Dark objects/things can still be seen by examine/looking at the object
  and @sweep picks up all dark things.
  
  RhostMUSH can be set up to mimic TinyMUSH in how it handles the dark
  flag for backward compatibility.  Check with your local wizards to
  see how it is set up here.
  
  See Also: UNFINDABLE, @sweep, look, examine
  
& DESTROY_OK
  DESTROY_OK(d)   
  
  When set on an object, it allows any player to destroy
  it as long as the object is not locked against them. This is good 
  for things like notes, whereby the recipient can destroy the note 
  after reading it, instead of having to look for you to destroy it.
  The DESTROY_OK flag overrides the SAFE flag, so that you do not need to
  give the /override switch to @destroy to destroy a thing that is both
  DESTROY_OK and SAFE.   The INDESTRUCTIBLE flag makes this meaningless.
  
  See Also: @destroy, SAFE, INDESTRUCTIBLE
  
& DOORED
  Flag: DOORED([R])  
  
  This is used in junction with the @door command.  This
  sets it so that you will receive no output from the MUSH while you
  are in the external door. (This can be overridden with wizard
  broadcasts for security/information reasons)
  
  See Also: @door
  
& ENTER_OK
  Flag: ENTER_OK(e)   
  
  If an object or person is ENTER_OK, other players may 
  enter the object or person by using 'enter <object/person>. Players
  must also have the ENTER_OK set if they wish to be able to receive 
  things given to them by other players via the 
  'give <player> = <object>'. 
  
  See Also: enter, give
  
& GOING
  Flag: GOING(G)  
  
  Used internally for the @destroy command, it is set on 
  anything that can be recycled. In the event that a player decides they 
  don't want to destroy the room after all then they can unset the BYEROOM
  flag.  Due to server modifications, you would unset the BYEROOM
  flag instead of the GOING flag to recover a room that has been
  @destroyed.  See the help on BYEROOM for more.  If you destroyed something
  you didn't intend, locate your nearest IMMORTAL (SUPER-ROYALTY) as soon
  as you can.
  
  See Also: BYEROOM, @destroy
  
& HAVEN
  Flag: HAVEN(H)  
   
  If a location is HAVEN, you cannot kill in that location.  The HAVEN flag
  no longer blocks pages or @pemits, use @lock/page instead.
   
  See Also: @lock
  
& KEY
  Flag: Flag: KEY(K)  
  
  When set on an object prevents puppets from picking it up.
  
  See Also: PUPPET, MONITOR
  
& LINK_OK
  Flag: LINK_OK(L)  
  
  If a room is LINK_OK, anyone can link exits to it (but 
  still not from it). It has no meaning for people, things, or exits.
  
  See Also: @link
  
& UNFINDABLE
  Flag: UNFINDABLE(U) 
  
  If a player is set UNFINDABLE, he cannot be found by 
  the loc() or room() functions.  Bummer.
  
  If a room is set UNFINDABLE, players in that room (or inside objects
  in the room) cannot be found by loc(),room(), or similiar functionality.
  
  See Also: DARK
  
& FLOATING
  Flag: FLOATING(F) 
  
  If a room is set floating, you will not be notified every 10 
  minutes or so that you have a disconnected room.
  
  If the player is set FLOATING, then they will receive no floating 
  messages.
 
  If master-room exits are set FLOATING, then they will not be displayed
  in the global exit lists on rooms you enter.
   
  See Also: NOTIFY_LINK
  
& NOCOMMAND
& NO_COMMAND
  Flag: NO_COMMAND([c])  
  
  If an object is set NO_COMMAND, all $commands and listens
  will no longer function on that object.
  
  This is aliased to 'NOCOMMAND' for compatibility.
   
  See Also: $-COMMANDS, ARBITRARY COMMANDS
  
& NOUNDERLINE
& NO_UNDERLINE
  Flag: NO_UNDERLINE([u])   
  
  When set on a player, it prevents that user from
  seeing (being annoyed by and/or having their win32 client program break)
  the underline/underscore ansi sequence.  This is the 'u' character with
  ansi().  Ex: ansi(u,annoyance)
  
  This is aliased to 'NOUNDERLINE' for compatibility.
   
  This will effectively strip out the ansi sequence for the underline routine.
  
  See Also: ANSI, ANSICOLOR, XTERMCOLOR, NO_FLASH, ansi()
  
& NOFLASH
& NO_FLASH
  Flag: NO_FLASH(-)   
  
  When set on a player, it prevents that user from seeing
  (being annoyed by) the ansi flashing sequence done by the 'f'
  argument to ansi(). Ex: ansi(f,annoyance)
  
  This will effectively strip out the ansi sequence for the flash routine.
  
  This is aliased to 'NOFLASH' for compatibility.
   
  See Also: ANSI, ANSICOLOR, XTERMCOLOR, NO_UNDERLINE, ansi()
  
& OPAQUE
  Flag: OPAQUE(O)   
  
  When set on a player, it prevents other players from 
  seeing what you are carrying in your inventory. Only exception is 
  when the object you are carrying belongs to the other player 
  looking at you.
  
  See Also: look
  
& THING
  Type: THING(T)
  A thing is a type that is neither exit, room, or player type.  It is
  something that can both be carried and which can carry something.
  
& PLAYER
  Type: PLAYER(P)  
  
  The PLAYER flag identifies you as a player. This flag cannot
  be reset by any player, not even a Wizard (not, yet, anyway 
  *grin*).  It is used mainly by the mush code to identify your 
  commands, check for validity of commands or locks etc. Generally, 
  just pretend it isn't even there.
  
  See Also: @list, @name, FLAG LIST
  
& JUMP_OK
  Flag: JUMP_OK(J)  
  
  When a room or thing is set JUMP_OK, then that location can
  be teleported into by anyone. See @teleport.
  
  See Also: @teleport, ABODE
  
& PRIVATE
  Flag: PRIVATE([P])  
  
  The private flag when set on EXITS makes them so that they
  are not inherited.  In other words, if you wanted to parent one room
  to another room, but didn't want a given exit to be inherited with
  the room and it's code, you would set the exit PRIVATE and it no longer
  would be inherited to the room's children.
  
  This flag, when set on a wizard, will snuff the special output of
  non-listening items arriving and leaving around them.
   
  See Also: @parent, @open
  
& PUPPET
  Flag: PUPPET(p)   
  
  Causes an object to grow eyes and ears, and relay all it sees 
  and hears to its owner.  
  
  See Also: @force, PUPPETS, #
  
& ROOM
  Type: ROOM(R)   
  
  This flag is automatically set on rooms when you @dig a new
  room. It cannot be changed. Rooms have the added advantage that 
  they can be saved from destruction by setting the room to !BYEROOM
  
  HELP BYEROOM
  
  However, this can only be done if no other room/object was created 
  that overwrote your room when it was set for destruction.
  
  See Also: BYEROOM, @dig
  
& VISUAL
  Flag: VISUAL(V)  
  
  The flag a lot of players have been waiting for. When set on
  your object, it allows other players to examine it and see all the
  object's attributes as if they owned the object. They cannot make 
  any changes to the object.  This was previously called SEE_OK in
  some MUSHes.
  
  See Also: ATTRIBUTE FLAGS
  
& QUIET
  Flag: QUIET(Q)  
  
  This flag when set on yourself prevents you from hearing 
  the 'set' or 'triggered' messages from any objects you own.  When 
  set on an object, only that object will not relay its messages.
  
  See Also: @set, &
  
& HALTED
  Flag: HALTED(h)  
  
  While this flag is set, the object cannot perform any mush 
  actions, listen, be triggered, etc.
  
  See Also: NOCOMMAND
  
& STICKY
  Flag: STICKY(S) 
  
  If a thing is STICKY, it goes home when dropped 
  (See HOMES). If a room is STICKY, its drop-to is delayed until the 
  last person leaves (See DROP-TOs). Only meaningful for things and 
  rooms. 
  
  See Also: HOMES, DROP-TOS
  
& TELOK
  Flag: TELOK([T])   
  
  The TELOK flag is used to enable bitted players (staff)
  the ability to set up so that they can be teleported around as if they
  were a mortal.  This is handy in testing code where @teleport is used.
  
  See Also: JUMP_OK, @teleport
  
& TEMPLE
  Flag: TEMPLE(T)  
  
  The TEMPLE flag is no longer a part of RhostMUSH. Check +help
  for information on +sacrifice.
  
  See Also: score
  
& ARCHITECT
  Flag: ARCHITECT(B)  
  
  If a player is ARCHITECT, they have various wizard powers
  available to them and fewer restrictions to do things.  They can
  do anything equal to or less than their power using #<number> or
  *<player>.  Only ROYALTY, SUPER-ROYALTY, or #1 can set this flag
  on players.
  
  See Also: GUILDMASTER, COUNCILOR, ROYALTY, IMMORTAL
  
& ROYALTY
  Flag: ROYALTY(W)   
  
  If a person is ROYALTY, they are a wizard, unkillable, 
  subject to fewer restrictions, and able to use wizard commands.  
  In general, ROYALTY can do anything using #<number> or *<player>. 
  Only player #1 or SUPER-ROYALTY can set and unset the ROYALTY flag of 
  other players.  No ROYALTY can turn their own ROYALTY flag off.   
  
  See Also: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, IMMORTAL
  
& SUPER-ROYALTY
& IMMORTAL
  Flag: SUPER-ROYALTY (IMMORTAL)(i)   
  
  This flag when set on a player allows them to be a hybrid wizard.  
  They can basically do anything, see anything, be anything.  The 
  only thing they can not do is set or unset this flag or directly 
  affect #1.  It's generally wise if you don't annoy these people.
  
  See Also: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, ROYALTY
  
& NOWALLS
& NO_WALLS
  Flag: NO_WALLS(w)   
  
  This flag when set will quiet all @walls or announcements
  heard by that player.  Note, important walls with the /no_prefix
  switch (ROYALTY and SUPER-ROYALTY only) will go through the NO_WALLS
  flag.
  
  This flag will also muffle @dump messages.
  
  See Also: NO_YELL, @wall
  
& CLOAK
  Flag: CLOAK(b)  
  
  This flag when set on a player will quiet all 'has arrived',
  'has left', 'has connected' and 'has disconnected' messages by that
  player.  Note, however, that that player still triggers action
  variables like @aenter.  This is settable by ROYALTY and SUPER-ROYALTY
  only.  You must be DARK as well to make this flag effectively work.
  
  See Also: DARK, UNFINDABLE, BLIND
  
& FUBAR
  Flag: FUBAR(f)  
  
  This flag when set permits the user to only pose and say.
  The user is incapable of doing anything else including QUIT.  Yet
  another consequence of annoying the wizards.  Settable by ROYALTY and
  SUPER-ROYALTY only.
  
  See Also: SLAVE
  
& GUILDMASTER
  Flag: GUILDMASTER(g)   
  
  This flag, when set on a player, allows that player a 
  few extra permissions like @quota and examining other's objects.
  This flag is settable only by ROYALTY and SUPER-ROYALTY.
  
  See Also: ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, ROYALTY, IMMORTAL
  
& VERBOSE
  Flag: VERBOSE(v)   
  
  This flag causes all commands executed by the object having
  the flag to be sent to the owner of the object.  i.e.:
  
      @create foo
      @set foo=VERBOSE
      @force foo="Hi.
      foo] "Hi.
      foo says "Hi."
  
  See Also: TRACE, PUPPET, trace()
  
& CONTROL_OK
  Flag: CONTROL_OK(z)  
  
  This flag currently serves no purpose within RhostMUSH.
  
& INHERIT
  Flag: INHERIT(I)   
  
  Previously, Wizard-owned objects had wizard powers.  This was
  a problem in many cases, so that behavior has changed.  Now, only Wizard
  objects or Wizard-owned Inherit-set objects have wizard powers.  Only
  players can set the Inherit flag, and the Inherit flag is reset during
  @chown.  If a player is set Inherit, all his stuff is assumed to be
  inherit, so his objects can control him.  If a player is NOT Inherit,
  his stuff does NOT control him.  (i.e. cannot @force him.)  This flag
  is not especially useful for non-wizards.
  
  Objects set INHERIT also inherit any powers that you yourself may have.
  
  It is generally good practice to NOT EVER set yourself inherit.
  
& MONITOR
  Flag: MONITOR(M)
  
  This flag does NOT return player connection/disconnection information.
  Check help @toggle for that.
   
  When set, anytime the object hears something from someone who passes the
  object's use lock, the object's attributes are scanned for attributes
  of the form '^<pattern>:<commandlist>'.  If the message matches the
  wildcarded <pattern>, then <commandlist> is executed, substituting %0 for
  the text that matched the first wildcard, %1 for the second, and so on.
  All matching attributes are executed, not just the first.
  Parents of MONITOR objects are never checked for ^-patterns.
 
  See Also: LISTENING, PUPPET
  
& ANSI
  Flag: ANSI(<)
  
  This flag is only meaningful for players.  When set, it allows ansi
  control codes to be sent to the player's terminal.  This does not in
  itself enable ansi color codes, but must be set in addition to the
  ANSICOLOR flag.  Without this flag, all ansi codes are stripped before
  you see them.
  
  You need both the ANSI and ANSICOLOR flags to see ansi color.
  
  See Also: ANSICOLOR, XTERMCOLOR, SUBSTITUTIONS, ANSI(), NOFLASH, COLORS()
  
& XTERMCOLOR
  Flag: XTERMCOLOR([t])
  
  This flag is only meaningful for players.  When set in conjunction with
  the ANSI and ANSICOLOR flags, this will allow 256 ansi color support using
  the XTERM color pallet to be sent to the player's terminal.
  
  You need all three flags:  ANSI, ANSICOLOR, and XTERMCOLOR to see extended.
  
  See Also: ANSI, ANSICOLOR, SUBSTITUTIONS, ANSI(), NOFLASH, COLORS()

  See Also: XTERMCOLOR, ANSI, ANSICOLOR, ANSI()

& ANSICOLOR
  Flag: ANSICOLOR(>)
  
  This flag is only meaningful for players.  When set in conjunction with
  the ANSI flag, this will allow ansi color codes to be sent to the 
  player's terminal.
  
  You need both the ANSI and ANSICOLOR flags to see ansi color.
  
  See Also: ANSI, XTERMCOLOR, SUBSTITUTIONS, ANSI(), NOFLASH, COLORS()
  
& ANSINAMES
  An addition to the code allows you to have ansi colors on ALL data types.
  This includes THINGs, EXITs, ROOMs, and yes, even PLAYERs.  This is done
  by setting ansi letter codes in the @ansiname attribute.  As long as
  the wizards haven't disabled you in particular or the mush as a whole
  from using ansi codes in that data type, it will now be colorized.
  
  See Also: @ansiname
  
& DEBUG
& TRACE
  Flag: TRACE(T)
 
  When a thing is set TRACE, it will report to its owner the result of all
  substitutions that it performs that change the original string.  The order
  for displaying nested evaluations (such as when evaluating the arguments to
  a function) is a site-selected configuration parameter.
 
  Example:
  > @set object = trace
  > @va object = say The result is [add(4,mul(3,%0))].
  > @trig object/va = 7
  object(#322)} '%0' -> '7'
  object(#322)} 'mul(3,%0)' -> '21'
  object(#322)} 'add(4,mul(3,%0))' -> '25'
  object(#322)} 'The result is [add(4,mul(3,%0))].' -> 'The result is 25.'
  object says "The result is 25."
  
{ 'help trace2' for more } 
& trace2
  When trace output is displayed in top-down order (final evaluation first,
  followed by the 'smaller' evaluations needed to perform it), then the total
  number of trace output lines that may be produced by an evaluation is limited
  to 200.  Bottom-up trace output is not limited.
  
  See Also: VERBOSE, PUPPET, trace(), chktrace()

& NOSPOOF
& NO_SPOOF
  Flag: NO_SPOOF(N)
 
  This flag gives you mucho output when people @emit.  It can be annoying,
  but you'll know who's spoofing.
  
  This is aliased to 'NOSPOOF' for compatibility.
   
  See Also: @emit, @femit, @oemit, @pemit
  
& PARENT_OK
  Flag: PARENT_OK(Y)
 
  If an object is set PARENT_OK, then any other object passing the object's
  ParentLock may make this object a parent of any object that it controls.
  Caution: allowing others to use your objects as parents lets them read the
  attributes on the object (as well as any parents of the object).
  
  See Also: @lock, PRIVATE, @parent
  
& LIGHT
  Flag: LIGHT(l)
  
  An object or exit that is set LIGHT is visible even when inside a DARK
  location.  If an object is set both DARK and LIGHT, then its contents are
  visible even though the object itself is not.
  
  See Also: DARK
  
& MYOPIC
  Flag: MYOPIC(m)
 
  If you are set MYOPIC, then you are treated as if you did not own anything
  when you use the LOOK command or when you automatically look at a location
  when entering it.  Other commands (such as EXAMINE) are not affected.
  
  See Also: DARK, look, TERSE
  
& TERSE
  Flag: TERSE(t)
   
  If you are set TERSE then you are not shown the description, success/failure
  messages, contents, or exits of locations you enter.  You must use the LOOK
  or EXAMINE commands to see this information.
   
  Others in the location still get the osucc/ofail messages and the asucc or
  afail command list is still run.
  
  If this is set on a ROOM, then the room will behave as if the person 
  entering is set TERSE.
   
  See Also: examine, look, MYOPIC
  
& ROBOT
  Flag: ROBOT(r)
 
  If set on a player, indicates that the player is a robot and is allowed to
  use the OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands that many publicly available
  robot programs require.  Some MUSHes do not restrict access to the
  OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands.
 
  If set on an exit or a thing, indicates that robot players may not use the
  exit or pick up the thing, the player is treated as having failed the lock.
  
  See Also: OUTPUTPREFIX, OUTPUTSUFFIX, @robot
  
& AUDIBLE
  Flag: AUDIBLE(n) (all types)
 
  When set on an object, player, or room everything from a say, pose, or emit
  inside the object will be sent to every object in the location of that
  object (except for rooms which have no location) as well as to all objects
  mentioned in the object's Forwardlist attribute.  When set on an exit,
  everything from a say, pose, or emit in the room the exit is in will be
  forwarded to the room the exit points to.  In both cases the @prefix
  attribute will be inserted in front of the text, or a default prefix if no
  @prefix attribute is set.  If the @filter attribute is present, it will be
  used to suppress those messages matching any of the patterns specified.
 
  See Also: @filter, @forwardlist, @prefix, PUPPET, MONITOR
 
& SAFE
  Flag: SAFE(s)
 
  When set, requires the use of the /override switch to @destroy in order to
  destroy the object.  It does not prevent the destruction of the object,
  but merely requires some additional effort.  If a thing is set DESTROY_OK,
  its SAFE flag is ignored and it may be destroyed without using the /override
  switch.
  
  See Also: @destroy, DESTROY_OK, INDESTRUCTABLE
  
& TRANSPARENT
  Flag: TRANSPARENT(T)
 
  If an exit is TRANSPARENT, then when you look at it you see the description
  of the room on the other side of the exit in addition to the description
  of the exit.  
  
  If a room is TRANSPARENT, it will use a long-list of exits and display them
  in the given room by showing the names of the rooms the exits link to.
  
  For example:
  A room that is not set TRANSPARENT:
    > look
    Room
    This is a description
    Obvious Exits:
    North <N>  South <S>
  
  The same room set TRANSPARENT:
    > look
    Room
    This is a description
    Obvious Exits:
    North <N> [leads to 'Room with a view']
    South <S> [leads to 'Under the carpet']
  
  See Also: @open, @dig
  
& SLAVE
  Flag: SLAVE(x)
 
  If set on a player, neither the player nor any of his objects may perform
  any commands that change the database.  Some sites may restrict additional
  commands.  This flag may only be set or cleared by wizards.
  
  See Also: FUBAR
  
& NOTEL
& NO_TEL
  Flag: NO_TEL(o)
 
  If set on a player or object it prevents that particular player or object
  from using @tel on itself or someone else (other than a wizard) from using
  @tel on them. The player or object may not use the 'home' command. This flag
  may only be set or cleared by wizards.
  
  See Also: home, @teleport
 
& NOYELL
& NO_YELL
  Flag: NO_YELL(y)
 
  If set on a player, prevents that player from using the @wall command. This
  flag may only be set or cleared by Architects and above.  This flag only
  has relevance for anyone under ARCHITECT in status.
  
  See Also: @wall, NO_WALLS
  
& FREE
  Flag: FREE(X)
 
  If set on an object, that object doesn't use up the owner's money (but
  can still give the owner's money away).
 
  If set on a player, that player has infinite money (unless they try to
  give money away, in which case they have normal money rules). This flag
  is settable only by Councilors and above.
  
  This flag works like IMMORTAL does on vanilla mushes but gives better
  monetary control.
  
  See Also: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, ROYALTY, IMMORTAL 
  
& INDESTRUCTIBLE
  Flag: INDESTRUCTIBLE(~)
  
  If set on an object, that object cannot be destroyed by any means, by 
  anyone. The flag must be removed before the object can be destroyed.
  This flag can be manipulated by Royalty and above only.
   
  See Also: SAFE, @destroy, BYEROOM, GOING
  
& ARBITRARY COMMANDS
  Topic: ARBITRARY COMMANDS
 
  You may define commands that are triggered whenever someone enters a command
  that matches the command template (wildcarding allowed).  These commands
  are called arbitrary commands, user-defined commands, or $-commands (for how
  they are defined), and they are checked for only after the check for
  single-character commands, exits, and internal commands have been performed
  and have failed (so an arbitrary command that matches 'page *' will never
  be performed).
 
  You define an arbitrary command by storing a string of the form
  '$<template>:<commandlist>' in an attribute of an object, then the command
  will be available to anyone who carries the object, is in the same room as
  the object, or is inside the object.  Only use user-named attributes and
  VA-VZ for arbitrary commands, as many of the predefined attributes are not
  for arbitrary commands.  <template> is the pattern to check for (it may
  contain wildcards), and <commandlist> is a semicolon-separated list of
  commands to perform.  The text that the wildcard characters matched are
  available in the variables %0 through %9.
  
{ 'help arbitrary2' for more }
  
& arbitrary2
  Example:
    > @va testobj = $foobar *:"I was foobar'ed with %0.
    Set.
    > foobar xyzzy
    testobj says "I was foobar'ed with xyzzy"
 
  You can prevent individual attributes from being checked for $-commands
  with the command '@set <obj>/<attr> = no_command'.  Attributes so set
  are reported with ($) following the attribute name when examined.
  The command '@set <obj>/<attr> = !no_command' clears the flag.
 
  The following attributes are never checked for $-commands: ALIAS CHARGES
  DESC DROP FAIL IDESC ODESC ODROP OFAIL OSUCC SEX SUCC.
  
  All $commands and ^listen pairs may be parsed using regular expressions.   
  
  See Also: @set, &, VATOVZ, ZATOZZ, $-COMMANDS, REGEXPS
  
& ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP
  Topic: ATTRIBUTE OWNERSHIP
  The attributes on an object may be owned independently from the object.
  Normally, the owner of the object owns all of its attributes.
  In addition to an owner, each attribute also has a locked flag,
  set or cleared with @lock <obj>/<attr> and @unlock <obj>/<attr>.
  This flag controls whether or not the owner of the object may
  @chown the attribute to himself with @chown <object>/<attrib>,
  as well as whether or not the attribute is automatically @chowned to
  the new owner when the object is @chowned.
 
  You may lock and unlock attributes that you own on any object (whether
  you own the object or not), and you may @chown an attribute that you own
  to the owner of the object if it is unlocked.  The examine command
  will show you all attributes that you own on an object, even if you
  don't own the object.
  
{ 'help attribute ownership2' for more }
  
& attribute ownership2
  Locked attributes may not be modified or removed, and do not change 
  ownership when the object containing them is @chowned.
 
  You may not modify or remove attributes that you own that are stored
  on objects that you do not own, but you may modify or remove attributes
  owned by others on your objects (if you do this, the attribute becomes owned
  by you).
 
  If an attribute is owned by someone other than the object's owner, then
  the number of the attribute's owner is shown in parentheses immediately
  after the attribute name.  If there are any flags set on the attribute,
  those flags are indicated in the parentheses too.
 
  The + flag means that the attribute is locked (so that it will not
  change ownership of the object is @chowned), the $ flag means that
  $-commands are not checked for that attribute.  The I flag indicates that
  the attribute is not inherited by children of the object, and the V flag
  shows that the attribute is publicly visible.
  
{ 'help attribute ownership3' for more }
  
& attribute ownership3
 
  When checking an attribute lock against an object, the lock will always
  fail if the locked object is not owned by the same player as the attribute
  being tested.  The comparison specified in the lock is only performed if
  the owner of the locked object also owns the attribute on the object
  being checked.
 
  See Also: @chown, @lock, @set, @unlock, examine
  
& ATTRIBUTE USELOCKS
  Topic: Attribute uselocks
  
  Attribute uselocks are a method where you can specify individual uselocks
  per command per object.  The path it takes to check uselocks are as 
  follows:
          No Command? -> Halted? -> Object Uselock -> Attribute Uselock
  
  To set up a uselock on a command, the attribute that houses the $command
  must first be set USELOCK.  Once the attribute is set USELOCK, you may
  then specify a lock for that attribute.  Attribute locks are created by
  setting an attribute with a '~' before the attribute name. Here's an
  example that you can look at:
    > @va me=$tryme:@pemit %#=You tried your command.
      Set.
    > @set me/va=uselock
      Set.
    > &~VA me=[match(%#,owner(me))]
      Set.
    > tryme
      You tried your command.
    > &~VA me=[match(#-1,owner(me))]
      Set.
    > tryme
      Huh?  (Type 'help' for help.)
  
{ See 'help attribute uselock2' to continue (and a description)}
  
& ATTRIBUTE USELOCK2
  Topic: Attribute uselocks (continued)
  
  As you could see, this can be very handy if you want multiple control
  on the same object.  The following specifies if you pass or fail an
  attribute uselock:
    For Passing:
          - If the uselock attribute does not exist.
          - If the uselock attribute returns a null (empty string).
          - If the uselock attribute returns a '1'.
  
    For failure:
          - If the uselock attributes returns anything except '1' or null.
  
  See @list options to see if USELOCKS are available for attributes.  
  Depending on the configuration of the rhostmush in question, uselocks may
  be disabled or you may need a wizard to set one up for you.
  
& ATTRIBUTE TREES
  Topic: Attribute trees
  
  For ease of documentation, the attribute tree character for this
  documentation will be the ` character.
  
  Attribute trees are defined by attributes that contain ` to break up each
  branch in a tree.  Example:  THIS`IS`A`TREE`ATTRIBUTE
  
  Note:  The tree character, while defaulting to ` can be defined as any
         character, and may be changed depending on the whim of the admin
         running your game.  Please check '@list options system' on what the
         current tree character is defined as.  
  
  @clusters and @wipe are not tree aware.  This is intentional, and will 
  not be worth the effort to make them so.  Please do not ask for it to happen.
   
  RhostMUSH does not, specifically, have attribute trees as you would define
  them as.  Rhost does, however, allow you to mimic the feature set with
  some relative ease to allow some compatibility to PennMUSH (and any other
  codebase that may pick up that option in the future).  It does that by
  the following ways:
  
  Please be aware while /tree will follow permissions on attribute branches,
  directly @setting it without the /tree will bypass a branch check.  This
  is, again, intentional, as this is just a method to allow trees in an
  environment that is not designed around, nor intended to, fully implement

& ATTRIBUTE TREE LIMITATIONS
  Topic: Attribute Trees/limitations
  
  There are caveats of using 'attribute trees' in RhostMUSH.  The largest of
  which, is the fact, that natively RhostMUSH does not support attribute 
  trees.  This is the case because of the binary database and the absolute
  overhead we would have implimenting a fully featured attribute tree system
  that would match (or exceed) what Penn offers.  The second, and larger
  issue is for the large amount of overhead this would cause, there really
  is very little gain out of it other than attribute organization. 
  
  Every time an attribute tree would be looked up, every conceiveable branch
  would have to be checked to see if permissions were granted.  While in
  Penn this would be less costly (but likely still costly for all the
  branch checks) in Rhost it would be doubly so.  We have to consider reality
  levels, the multiple bitlevel checks, all the various locks, all the various
  @powers, all the various @depowers, all the various built-in capping and
  conditionals, and do a hash lookup of every single attribute on the object
  for every single branch of every single pattern on the object itself for 
  every single branch in every single chain for every single lookup.  
  That would be a horrible waste of resources for minimal gains.
  
  So with that in mind, these are the limitations of Rhost with Attrib Trees:
    1.  @cluster/@wipe/wipe() is not attribute tree aware.  It likely won't be.
    2.  You can orphan a branch from a trunk if a further branch is locked.
        Remember, these are not true trees, just an imitation of them.
    3.  The set()/@set/lattr/examine/decompile honors the attribute tree
        permissions but only if the tree option is specified for them.
        Otherwise, it sees it just like any other attribute.
    4.  You can orphan a tree branch by setting an empty attribute (removing)
        it as it doesn't check branches of that attribute for permissions.
        So be careful.
    5.  This is intended to emulate the most used feature sets of Penn and
        was able to be done with minimal overhead.  Again, we have no
        interests nor desire to duplicate Penn's capabilities in this
        avenue as we see it directly opposite of our own agendas and goals.

& ATTRIBUTE TREE SETTING
  Topic: Attribute Trees/setting
  
  The following ways allow you to set trees and follow branching.
  Please be aware, @clusters and @wipe ARE NOT TREE AWARE!!!
  
  Setting Attributes:
    @set  -- @set has a /tree switch, that when used with attribute setting,
             will set the entire branch list included in the attribute.  The
             /tree switch is ignored for anything not involving setting or
             clearing attributes.
           > Example:  @set/tree MyObj=A`TREE`ATTRIB:Boo!
  
    &     -- &, when using ` as the first char, will tell & to set the attrib
             as if it was setting the tree.  
           > Example:  &`A`TREE`ATTRIB MyObj=Boo!
  
    set() -- set() has a third optional argument to tell it it's to set a
             tree.  The rset() function has this option as well.
           > Example:  set(MyObj,A`TREE`ATTRIB:Boo!,1)
  
  See Also: @set, &, set(), rset(), lattr()
{ wiz help: @aflags, @admin, vlimit, @attribute, lattrp() }
  
& ATTRIBUTE TREE VIEWING
  Topic: Attribute Trees/viewing
  
  The following ways allow you to view/examine trees and follow branching.
  Please be aware, @clusters and @wipe ARE NOT TREE AWARE!!!
  
  Viewing Attributes:
    ex    -- The examine command has a /tree option that lets you examine just
             the specified branch level itself.  If you want the tree and all
             branches, specify ex without the /tree switch.
           > Example: ex/tree MyObj/A`TREE*
  
    @dec  -- The @decompile command has a /tree option that lets you 
             @decompile the specified branch level itself.  If you want the
             tree and all branches, specify @decomile without the /tree switch.
           > Example: @decompile/tree MyObj/A`TREE*
  
    lattr -- lattr() as well as lattrp() has a key option that lets you specify
             if it should only give you trees per wildcarding.  This works like
             ex and @dec.
           > Example: lattr(MyObj/A`TREE*,,,,,1)
  
  See Also: @set, &, set(), rset(), lattr()
{ wiz help: @aflags, @admin, vlimit, @attribute, lattrp() }

& ATTRIBUTE TREE PERMISSION
  Topic: Attribute Trees/permission
  
  The following ways allows you to set permissions on various tree branches.
  Please be aware, @clusters and @wipe ARE NOT TREE AWARE!!!
  
  Locking Attributes:
    @lock -- Yup.  You can @lock an attribute and if it won't have permission
             to the branch, you won't have permission to the entire tree.
             All it takes is one branch of the tree to block the entire thing.
           > Example: @lock MyObj/A`TREE=me
  
    @aflag-- The @aflags wiz command allows you to set up attribute prefixes
             globally, individually, per owner, per object, or per enactor.
             Trees would check for these locks as well.
           > Example: See: wizhelp @aflags
   
    VLIMIT-- If you hit the maximum number of attributes or will hit the
             maximum number by setting all the trunks before the attribute,
             it will not set the attribute.
           > Example: See: wizhelp @admin, wizhelp vlimit
  
  See Also: @set, &, set(), rset(), lattr()
{ wiz help: @aflags, @admin, vlimit, @attribute, lattrp() }

& BEING KILLED
  Topic: BEING KILLED  
 
  Getting killed is no big deal. If you are killed, you return to your home,
  and  all things you carry return to their homes. You also collect 50 coins
  in insurance money (unless you have >= 10000 coins or you were killed via
  the Wizard slay command).  Generally, killing is not encouraged unless 
  absolutely necessary. (Note: Killing a wizard is a quick way to discover
  the many uses of the @boot command...  and killing anyone can be very
  rude.  However, on the RhostMUSH server, wizards are usually more inventive)
  
  See Also: kill, @akill, @kill, @okill, IMMORTAL, ROYALTY
  
& BOGUS COMMANDS
  Topic: BOGUS COMMANDS    
  
  Bogus commands can be made using exits. For example, to make a 'sit'
  command, one could "@open sit", then "@link sit=here" (because unlinked
  exits can be stolen), "@lock sit=#0" (impossible for a room to pass a lock,
  #0 is always a room, therefore the lock always fails), and "@fail sit=You
  sit on the chair."; "@ofail sit=sits on the chair.".  Since nobody can go
  through it, it always fails. The @fail message is displayed  to the player,
  and the @ofail message (preceded by the player's name) to  everyone else.  
  
  For bogus commands, you may look at $commands instead as it doesn't take up
  valuable quota. (see help for $-commands)
  
  See Also: @afail, @fail, @link, @lock, @ofail, @open, $-COMMANDS
  
& BOOLEAN VALUES
  Topic: BOOLEAN VALUES
 
  Boolean values are internally considered to be either 1, generally
  interpreted as being true, and 0, which is generally interpreted as being
  false. Now, any string is interpreted as true(1), except for the null
  string (whose length is 0), which is false(0).  A #-1 is interpreted as
  false(0), and any other #<dbref> is interpreted as true(1).  Any number
  except 0 is interpreted as true(1), except 0 which is false(0). (Yes, even
  negative numbers are true(1))
 
  Examples:
  not(foo) = 0             not(<null string>) = 1   not(-66) = 0
  not(0) = 1               not(#-1) = 1             not(#12) = 0
  And so on...
 
  Note: These rules only apply when a function expects a Boolean 
  value, not for strings that expect other values.
  
  See Also: FUNCTION CLASSES
  
& CONTROL
  Topic: CONTROL      
 
  There are 6 rules to controlling objects:
   1) You control anything you own as long as it's not set NOMODIFY/NOEXAMINE.
   2) Anything you own that has its INHERIT flag set controls anything you 
      own (including you).
   3) Anything you own that does not have its INHERIT flag set only controls
      other things that you own that do not have their INHERIT flag set and
      do not control you, unless YOU have your inherit flag set.
   4) A wizard controls everything.
   5) Anybody controls an unlinked exit, even if it is locked.
   6) You have attribute-modification control on anything with a twinklock
      which you pass.
 
  Builders should beware of 5, lest their exits be linked or stolen.
  Coders should beware of 6, lest their code be modified.
   
  Most of the commands for altering the database and many commands and
  functions that retrieve information only work on objects that you control.
  
& COSTS      
  Topic: COSTS
 
  Certain commands cost money to use, they will fail if you don't have
  enough.  Use the @list costs command to find out what these commands are
  and how much they cost.

& DROP-TOS
  Topic: DROP-TOS
 
  When the @link command is used on a room, it sets a drop-to location.  Any
  object dropped in the room (if it isn't STICKY) will go to that location.
  If the room is STICKY, the drop-to will be delayed until the last person in
  the room has left.
  
  See Also: @link, STICKY
  
& ENACTOR
  Topic: ENACTOR
 
  The enactor is the object that caused an action list to be performed.
  So, the enactor of the Ahear action list is the player or object who
  said/emoted/etc the message that matched the Listen attribute, the
  enactor of the Apay attribute is the player who gave the object money, etc.
  The enactor of an attribute that is run by a @trigger command is the 
  object that ran the @trigger command.  The following substitutions can be
  performed in an action list to return information about the enactor:
 
    %# or [v(#)]           - Database number of the enactor
    %N/%n or [v(N)]/[v(n)] - Name of the enactor.
    %O/%o ...              - Objective pronoun for the enactor
                             (him her it them)
    %P/%p ...              - Possessive pronoun (his her its their)
    %S/%s ...              - Subjective pronoun (he she it they)
    %A/%a ...              - Absolute possessive pronoun (his hers its theirs)

& MOVING
  Topic: MOVING
 
  A number of things happen when you leave one location and enter another
  (assuming you pass the lock on the exit or have permission to enter the
  object or to teleport to the location).  The following list describes the
  actions that MUSH takes when an object moves from one place to another.
  Note that if an indicated attribute is not set, no message is displayed
  (or no action is performed).
 
  - If you are using an exit (as opposed to teleporting, entering an object,
    or going home), You receive the SUCC message for the exit, others in the
    old location receive the exit's OSUCC message, and the exit runs its
    ASUCC action list.
  - If you are teleporting or being teleported, others in the old location
    receive your OXTPORT attribute.
  - If you are a player or have your LISTEN attribute set to something,
    and if the old location is not dark and you are not dark, you receive the
    LEAVE message for the old location, others in the old location receive
    the OLEAVE message, and the old location runs its ALEAVE action list.
    Others in the new location receive the OXENTER message from the old
    location, and others in the old location receive the message '<yourname>
    has left.'
  
{ 'help moving2' for more }
  
& moving2
  - You are moved to the new location.  If you are entering an object,
    teleporting, or going home, all KEY objects are stripped from you.
  - If the new location is a room, you receive the room's DESC, others in the
    room receive the ODESC, and the room runs its ADESC.  If you pass the
    room's lock do the same with SUCC, OSUCC, and ASUCC, otherwise use FAIL,
    OFAIL, and AFAIL.
  - If the new location is a player or an object, you receive the location's
    IDESC (or DESC if the IDESC is not set).  In either event, others in the
    same location see the ODESC message and the location runs its ADESC 
    action list.
  - You are shown the contents and visible exits if the location is not DARK.
  - If you used an exit, then you receive the DROP message for the exit,
    others in the new room receive the exit's ODROP message, and the exit
    runs its ADROP action list.
  - If you are teleporting or being teleported, you receive your TPORT
    attribute, others in your new location receive your OTPORT attribute,
    and your ATPORT attribute is run.
  - You receive your MOVE attribute, others in your new location receive
    your OMOVE attribute, and your AMOVE attribute is run.
  
{ 'help moving3' for more }
  
& moving3
  - If you are a player, or have your LISTEN attribute set to something,
    and if the old location is not dark and you are not dark, you receive the
    ENTER message for the new room, others in the new room receive the OENTER
    message, and the new room runs its AENTER action list. Others in the room
    you just left receive the new room's OXLEAVE message, and others in the
    old location receive the message '<yourname> has arrived.'
  - If the old location is a STICKY room and has its drop-to set, see if
    objects in that room should be sent to the drop-to location.  If so,
    do it.
  - If you are a player, you have a chance of finding some money.

& EXITS
  Topic: EXITS (E)
 
  An exit links one location to another location, providing a way to travel
  on the MUSH.  Although normally used to link rooms together, exits can be
  made to and from players and objects.
 
  You may pick up exits that you own, and drop exits into locations that
  you own.  When you pick up or drop an exit, anyone in the exit's new
  location may use the exit and travel to its destination.
 
  If an exit is set DARK it will not show up in the list of obvious exits in
  a room.
  
  See Also: @link, @open
  
& FAILURE
  Topic: FAILURE  
 
  You fail to use a player or a thing when you cannot take it (because it's
  lock fails).  You fail to use an exit when you cannot go through it
  (because it is unlinked or locked). You fail to use a room when you fail
  to look around (because it's locked).
  
  See Also: get, look, @afail, @fail, @lock, @ofail
  
& FLAGS
  Topic: FLAGS
 
  Everything in the universe of this MUSH (Rooms, Exits, Things, Players,
  etc) are represented in the same way at the program level.  A room merely
  has the room flag set and a player has the player flag set.  In addition,
  flags also give objects abilities or qualities.  For instance, a wizard
  has the wizard flag set.  That is what lets the program know he may use
  wizard abilities.  An object or room may have the dark flag set. In the
  case of an object, this makes the object invisible to normal eye-sight.
  In the case of a room, the room becomes too dark to see other objects or
  players.  To get a list of the flags that are available, type '@list flags'
  or 'help flag list'. For more specific information on a particular flag,
  request help on the flag's name, as in 'help ENTER_OK'.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG HIDDEN
& ATTRIBUTE FLAG MDARK
  Attribute Flag: MDARK(M)       [HIDDEN]
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=hidden

  This attribute will be hidden.  If used in junction with the bitlevel flags,
  then it will be hidden to anyone below that bitlevel.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG PRIVATE
  Attribute Flag: PRIVATE(null)
  This is automatically added and can not be set individually.
  
  The attribute is private and can only be seen by the owner or anyone who 
  controls that attribute and/or object.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG NO_CLONE
  Attribute Flag: NO_CLONE(N)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=no_clone
  
  The attribute is not copied over when the object is @cloned.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG NO_PARSE
  Attribute Flag: NO_PARSE(n)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=no_parse
  
  The attribute does not parse input the player types.  All %0-%9 attributes
  are taken 'as-is' from the player.  This is useful to $command and ^listen
  attributes.
  
& ATTRIBUTE FLAG SAFE
  Attribute Flag: SAFE(s)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=safe
  
  The attribute is set safe and by default can not be touched when @wiped or
  removed or modified in any way.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG PINVISIBLE
  Attribute Flag: PINVISIBLE(p)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=pinvisible
  
  The attribute is cloaked, meaning that it can not be seen through examine,
  lattr, or any method of listing attributes on an object, but can still
  be called directly with a get() or u() if you know the attribute name.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG DARK
  Attribute Flag: DARK(D)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=dark (only by #1)
  
  The attribute is system-hidden.  This is intended as an internal flag only.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG USELOCK
  Attribute Flag: USELOCK(u)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=uselock
  
  The attribute will be checked against attribute uselocks.  Please see
  the section on ATTRIBUTE USELOCk for more information.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG SINGLETHREAD
  Attribute Flag: SINGLETHREAD(S)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=singlethread
  
  If set on an attribute with a $command or ^listen, that attribute will be
  single-thread evaluated.  Essentially, it automatically sets the attribute
  NO_COMMAND upon execution of the command/listen, and will remain set
  NO_COMMAND until you manually unset the attribute flag.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG DEFAULT
  Attribute Flag: DEFAULT(F)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=default
  
  The attribute will inherit formatting from the global format parents.
  See wizhelp on ATTRIB FORMATTING for more information.

& ATTRIBUTE FLAG ATRLOCK
  Attribute Flag: ATRLOCK(l)
  Set by: @set #obj/attr=atrlock
  
  This specifies that the attribute has a content lock.  Content locks mean
  that you must match specific patterns to set or clear that attribute.
  See wizhelp on ATTRIB CONTLOCKS for more information.

  matching is done through regular expression matching instead of the default
  of glob pattern matching.

& TOGGLES
  Topic: TOGGLES
  
  Toggles may be set on objects to alter the way the mush treats them.
  They are similar to flags, but are usually of a more minor 
  consequence. To set or unset a toggle, the @toggle command is used.
  For a list of toggles see 'help toggle list'.

  For information on a particular toggle, type 'help <togglename>'.
  If the name of a toggle is similar to the name of another help
  entry you may need to add the word 'toggle'. As in 'help monitor toggle'.

& FUNCTIONS
  Topic: FUNCTIONS
   
  Functions are specialized commands used to manipulate strings and other
  input. The format for a function is of this form: [fun-name(<input>)]
  Although usually the []'s indicate an input that is optional, in this case
  they are necessary and tell the MUSH that this is a function, although
  nested functions (like [first(rest(This is a nice day))] returns 'is') do
  not require more than one pair of []'s.  Nested brackets may be used when
  it is necessary to insert a function call in the middle of an argument,
  like [get(me/[get(me/vz)])], which returns the contents of the attribute
  named in the VZ attribute.
   
  For help on a particular function, type 'help <functionname>'.  You may
  need to include the parentheses with the function name, IE.
  'help <functionname>()'.  
  
  'help function list' or '@list functions'  - quick list available functions

& GENDER
  Topic: GENDER
 
  A player's (virtual) gender is specified in the Sex attribute.  This
  attribute controls how gender-specific pronoun substitutions are evaluated
  for the player.  If the player's Sex attribute starts with an 'M' or an 'm'
  then the player is assumed to be male,  'F', 'f', 'W', and 'w' indicate
  female, and anything else indicates neuter.
  
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS
  
& GOALS
  Topic: GOALS
 
  There is no ultimate goal to this game, except to have fun.  There are
  objects and places to build, puzzles to solve, scenery to visit, and people
  to meet. There are no winners or losers, only fellow players.  Enjoy.
  
& HERE
  Topic: HERE 
 
  The word 'here' refers to the room you are in (if you are inside an object,
  it refers to the object that you are in, not the room that the object is
  in).  For example, to rename the room you are in (if you control it), you
  could enter '@name here= <new name>'.
  
  See Also: ME
  
& HOMES
  Topic: HOMES
 
  Every thing or player has a home.  This is where players when they go home,
  or things with the STICKY flag set go when dropped.  Homes are set with the
  @link command. A thing's home defaults to the room where it was created, if
  you control that room, or your home. You can link an exit to send players
  home with '@link <dir>=home'.  Drop-tos can also be set to 'home'.
  
  See Also: @link, DROP-TO, STICKY
  
& LINKING  
  Topic: LINKING
 
  You can link to a room if you control it, or if it is set LINK_OK or ABODE.
  Being able to link means you can set the homes of objects or yourself to
  that room if it is set ABODE, and that you can set the destination of exits
  to that room if it is LINK_OK.
  
  See Also: @link, ABODE, LINK_OK
  
& LISTENING
  Topic: LISTENING
 
  Thee are two ways to listen for something in a room. The easiest way
  is to use a combination of @listen and @ahear/@aahear/@amhear. The
  second way is to use a "^" pattern in an attribute, similar to the way
  "$" is used for user-defined commands. The attribute takes the form:
  '^<pattern>:<action>'.
 
  The ^-pattern check is only performed on objects with their MONITOR flag
  set.  The criterion for triggering a pattern-listen is the same as that for
  triggering an @ahear - the object cannot trigger its own listen patterns.
  All matching attributes have their <action>s performed, not just the first.
  Also, attributes with the no_command flag set are not checked for 
  ^-patterns, and neither are objects' parents.
 
  Example:
    > @va test = ^* says "foo *":say I got a foo with %1!.
    Set.
    > @set test=monitor
    test grows ears and can now hear.
    > say foo bar
    You say "foo bar"
    test says "I got a foo with bar!."
  
  See Also: @ahear, @listen, @set, PUPPET, AUDIBLE, MONITOR
  
& LISTS
  Topic: LISTS
 
  A list is a string, usually stored in an attribute (currently any of the
  va-vz attributes), which is a series of words, separated by one or more
  spaces.  The following would be a list (denoted on the ends by ', which is
  not actually in the string): 'one two three four five'.  The functions
  first(), rest(), cat(), member(), and remove(), all work on lists.
   
  See Also: cat(), first(), member(), remove(), rest(), randextract()
  
& LOOPING
  Topic: LOOPING
 
  Looping in an object can have its good parts and its bad parts.  The good
  part is when you activate part of a program multiple times to exhaustively
  perform an operation.  This is usually done by:
     @va object =  <list of commands>;@trigger me/vb
     @vb object =  @switch <test> = <false>,@trigger me/va,<otherwise go on>
 
  Looping can be a problem when it goes on without stopping.  The @ps command
  can be used to see if you are looping.  Beware!  A looping machine that
  isn't @halt'ed will drain your money supply while you are away!
  
  See Also: @dolist, @halt, @ps, @notify, @drain, @wait, @trigger
  
& ME
  Topic: ME
  The word 'me' refers to yourself. Some things to do when starting out: 
  1) give yourself a description with 
     '@describe me = <description>', then look at yourself with 'look me'.
  2) set your gender, if you wish it known, with
     '@sex me=male' or '@sex me=female'  (or '@sex me=neuter' to be an 'it').
  3) To lock yourself, type: @lock me=me

& MONEY
  Topic: MONEY
 
  You need money to build within the game, to run programmed objects or use
  certain other commands, or to buy things from vendors set up by other
  players.  You can get money via one or more of these methods:
    1.  You receive a daily allowance for each day you connect.
    2.  You have a chance of finding money as you wander around areas that
        other people have built.
    3.  Some MUSHes may implement a place where you can sell valuable objects
        for money.
  
  Money is used by the following methods (the most common)
    1.  Any command put into the queue takes money
    2.  Creating/digging/opening/etc (basically building) costs money
    3.  Wondering objects take a lot of money.
  
  It's generally a silly idea to have a lot of money so don't ask for a lot.

& PUPPETS
  Topic: PUPPETS
 
  An object is made into a puppet by doing '@set <object>=puppet', once an
  object is a puppet it will relay all that it sees and hears to its master.
  All objects created by a puppet are owned by its master, when puppets spend
  or earn money, they use their master's money supply.  In order to prevent
  puppets from screwing up puzzles, objects may have the KEY flag set, this
  will prevent puppets from picking the object up. A puppet may be commanded
  by its master by '@force <object>=command', or by the shorthand version, 
  '#<number of puppet> command'.  The puppet flag is handy for debugging, as
  it allows you to see the result messages your object generates.
 
  Example:       
  @force fred="hi there.  -or-  #4342 "hi there.

& search classes
  Topic: SEARCH CLASSES
 
  You may use the following classes in @search, search() and searchng()
  function calls:
  
  TYPE      - Restricts to objects of the indicated type (OBJECTS, ROOMS,
              EXITS, PLAYERS).  THINGS may be used as an alias for OBJECTS.
  NAME      - Restricts to objects whose names start with <restriction>.
  OBJECTS   - A combination of TYPE=OBJECT and NAME=<restriction>.
  THINGS    - An alias for OBJECTS.
  ROOMS     - A combination of TYPE=ROOM and NAME=<restriction>.
  EXITS     - A combination of TYPE=EXIT and NAME=<restriction>.
  PLAYERS   - A combination of TYPE=PLAYER and NAME=<restriction>.
  FLAGS     - Restricts to objects which have the flags listed in
              <restriction> set..
  FLAGS2    - Restricts to objects which have the flags listed in
              <restriction> set.. (uses next set of flags)
  EVAL      - Evaluates the restriction for each object, replacing ##
              with the object's database number.  Evaluations that return
              TRUE (IE, not 0 or #-1) are selected.
  EOBJECT   - A combination of TYPE=OBJECT and EVAL=<restriction>.
  ETHING    - An alias for OBJECTS.
  EROOM     - A combination of TYPE=ROOM and EVAL=<restriction>.
  EEXIT     - A combination of TYPE=EXIT and EVAL=<restriction>.
  EPLAYER   - A combination of TYPE=PLAYER and EVAL=<restriction>.
  
& SEMAPHORES
  Topic: SEMAPHORES
 
  Semaphores may be used for synchronizing complex objects or for enforcing
  mutual exclusion.  You may use any object you own or any LINK_OK object as
  a semaphore, and any type of object (thing, room, player, or exit) may be
  used.
 
  The semaphore state of an object is shown by the Semaphore attribute (which
  is read-only); a positive number indicates the number of commands awaiting
  notifies, and a negative number indicates the number of waits on that
  semaphore that will not block.
 
  Use the '@wait <object>' form of the @wait command to request a command be
  delayed until <object> is notified with the @notify command.  The @drain
  and @notify/all commands clear the semaphore on <object>, either
  discarding or executing all pending commands.  Remember that the
  object performing the @wait executes the command, not the object used
  as a semaphore. 
  
{ 'help semaphores2' for more }
& semaphores2
  You may also combine the semaphore and timer options of @wait with
  '@wait <object>/<timeout> = <command>'  If the time period expires before
  the semaphore is notified, then the command is executed and the semaphore
  count is decremented, just as if the command had been run because the
  semaphore had been notified.
 
  Examples: <simple>     @wait semaphore="Foo
                         @notify semaphore
            <mutex lock> @va mutex lock=@wait me=@trig me/vb
                         @vb mutex lock="Got it!;@notify me
                         @startup mutex lock=@notify me
            <timed wait> @wait timer/60 = "Sixty Second Timer.
 
  In the above examples you will say "Foo" after semaphore is notified,
  you will say "Got it" when you have the mutual exclusion lock mutex lock
  (You could have also modified object registers that need to be protected
  from concurrent update), and you will say "Sixty Second Timer." either when
  timer is notified or after sixty seconds pass.

& SPOOFING
  Topic: SPOOFING
 
  Spoofing is the act of making other characters think that a person said or
  did something that they did not.  This is very easy to accomplish, and has
  some good effects, which is why it is allowed.  Note that the NOSPOOF flag
  allows players to see exactly who is spoofing what.  Be warned, wizards are
  rumored to have ways to find those who spoof them.
 
  Example:
    ... From TinyJerk's perspective ...
    > @emit Wizard is a jerk!
    Wizard is a jerk.
 
   ... From Wizard's perspective, Wizard is set NO_SPOOF ...
   [TinyJerk(#226)] Wizard is a jerk!
   > @boot tinyjerk
   You booted TinyJerk off!
   TinyJerk has disconnected.
   1 connection closed.
 
   ... TinyJerk's perspective again ...
   Wizard gently shows you the door.

& STACK
  Topic: STACK
 
  Command lists that are run on objects can have up to 10 stack values
  named %0 through %9 (or [v(0)] through [v(9)]).  Stack values can be set
  by the @trigger command, or by matching wildcard characters in the Listen
  attribute (in the case of the Ahear, Aahear, and Amhear attributes).
 
  Example:
    > @listen item = * foo *
    Set.
    > @ahear item = "-->[v(1)]<-- bar -->[v(0)]<--
    Set.
    > say Fee fie foo fum
    You say "Fee fie foo fum"
    item says "-->fum"<-- bar -->Wizard says "Fee fie<--"

& SUBSTITUTIONS
  Topic: SUBSTITUTIONS
 
  All messages may contain %-substitutions, which evaluate to gender-specific
  pronouns if the player's gender is set or to other useful information.
  Information returned is based on the player that caused the message to be
  displayed, not the object that stored the message or which is running the
  action list.  The substitutions available are:
 
    %s, %S  = Name, he, she, it, they.        (subjective)
    %o, %O  = Name, him, her, it, them.       (objective)
    %p, %P  = Name's, his, her, its, their.   (possessive)
    %a, %A  = Name's, his, hers, its, theirs. (absolute possessive)
    %n, %N  = the player's name.
    %k, %K  = the player's colorized/accented name.
    %w, %W  = the target dbref# of the twinklock (if applicable)
    %r      = carriage return.
    %t      = tab character.
    %b      = space character.
    %%      = literal '%' character.
    %0-%9   = Value of positional parameter/stack location 0 through 9.
    %-      = Stack 10+ that are comma delimited
    %i0-%i9 = Equivalent to itext(0) through itext(9). [%il for outer]
    %d0-%d9 = Equivalent to dtext(0) through dtext(9).  [%dl for outer]
              Only useable with /inline only.
    %q0-%q9 = Value of registers.  Basically equivalent to [r(0)] - [r(9)].
    %qa-%qz = Extended value of registers.
    %va-%vz = Contents of attribute va through vz.
  
  Note: %q<label> works for setq labels.  ie.  [setq(0,foo,bar)]%q<bar>

& substitutions2
    %#      = Database number of the object that caused the message to be

    %l      = Database number of the location of the object that caused the
              message to be displayed or the action list to be run.
    %!      = Database number of the object holding the message or running
              the action list.
    %@      = Database number of the object immediately calling %! (Caller).
              This number starts as the same as %#, but can be affected by
              u()-type functions, zones, and @function.
    %+      = Show the total arguments a function received.
    %?      = Show current function invocation as well as current nest levels.
    %c      = ANSI substitution or Last Command Executed.
    %x      = ANSI substitution or Last Command Executed.
    %m      = ANSI substitution or Last Command Executed.

              The functionality of above subs depends on compile options:

            * ANSI substitution: It takes the next character as the ansi
              sequence and continues with that sequence till the next one
              or end of the line.  You may also specify 0x## (ie: 0x20)
              to use extended 256 colors.

            * Last Command Executed: The substitution contains the whole,
              unevaluated code of the last command executed.

    %f      = Specify template for accent handler for strings.  To see a list
              of templates, see help on the accent() function.
    %<      = Used for UNICODE (ASCII 160 through 255).  Syntax: %<###>
              This requires the ACCENT toggle to utilize.
  
  Note:  The functionality of '%c' and '%x' may be switched.  Check
         @list options to check.
  
  Note:  The functionality of '%f' is only useable if ZENTY_ANSI is enabled.
         The functionality of '%<' is only useable if ZENTY_ANSI is enabled.
         The functionality of '%<' requires the ACCENTS toggle.
   
  If the letter following the % is capitalized, the first letter of the
  result of the substitution is also capitalized.
   
  Note: %<whatever> is equivalent to [v(<whatever>)], but is more efficient.
        This _ONLY_ works for @va to @vz attributes currently.  Sorry.

& SUCCESS
  Topic: SUCCESS
 
  You successfully use a player or a thing when you take it (because you
  passed the lock).  You successfully use an exit when you go through it.
  You successfully use a room when you look around and the room is not locked
  against you.

& SWITCHES
  Topic: SWITCHES
 
  Some commands have command switches associated with them that can be used
  to modify their behavior.  For instance, switches on the @ps command
  control the amount of information displayed, and switches on the @switch
  command indicate whether to perform all actionlists whose targets match
  the search string, or just the first.
  
  See Also: @list
  
& OBJECT TYPES
  Topic: OBJECT TYPES
 
  There are 4 types of objects: things, players, exits, and rooms. The first
  letter following an object's ID number indicates the type: P(layer),
  E(xit), R(oom), otherwise, thing.  Things are inanimate objects that can
  be carried.  Players are animate objects that can move and carry. Exits
  are the means by which objects move from room to room. Rooms are locations
  that contain objects and linked exits.

& COMMAND EVALUATION
  Topic: COMMAND EVALUATION
 
  When you submit a command to be executed by MUSH (whether by typing it in or
  by having a machine run it, the following steps are performed, in sequence.
  If the command matches something in a step, the matching actions are
  performed and the walk down the list stops.  Note the STOP and NO_STOP flags
  effect the sequence.
 
  - If the command was typed in, it is checked against the uppercase-only
    commands (QUIT, WHO, etc).  If so, the command is executed.
  - The first letter of the command is checked to see if it is a single-
    character command (", :, etc).  If so, %-substitution and function
    evaluation may be performed (depending on the command), and the command
    is executed.
  - The command is checked to see if it is the 'home' command.  If so, the
    player or object performing the command goes home.
  - The command is checked against the exits in its current room.  If one
    matches, it is performed.  If more than one matches, one is picked 
    randomly from the exits for which the player passes the lock (If the 
    player does not pass any locks, then the exit to be tried is picked 
    randomly.
  
{ 'help command evaluation2' for more }
  
& command evaluation2
  - The first word of the command is checked to see if it is an internal MUSH
    command.  If so, the remainder of the command is broken up into arguments,
    %-substitution and function evaluation may be performed on the (split up)
    arguments, and the command is executed.
  - %-substitution and function evaluation is performed on the command.
  - All objects in the player's inventory, all objects in the player's
    location, and the location itself are searched for $-commands that match
    the command.  All that match are performed.  The player may or may not be
    checked, depending on how the MUSH is configured.
 
  Note: Commands that can cause other commands to be executed (such as @wait,
  @switch, @trigger, etc) never perform substitution on their arguments, they
  leave the evaluation to the command that is to be executed.  This prevents
  most of the problems with getting objects to perform unintended commands by
  putting a ';', '}', or ',' in an argument.  The @force command is an
  exception in that it evaluates its argument, so it should be used with
  caution (preferably by never using it to pass information that someone else
  entered, use @trigger instead).
 
  Also, the construct '$xx *:%0' does not work (and is very dangerous
  programming), use '$xx *:@force me=%0' if you need this functionality.
  
  Command evaluation may be effected by the NO_COMMAND, STOP, or NO_STOP flags.
  
& VERBS
  Topic: VERBS
 
  For many verbs there are three attributes that specify messages and actions
  associated with the verb in addition to the verb's built-in action.
  The attributes are named Verb, Overb, and Averb.  Verb is the message that
  the enactor sees, Overb is the message that everyone else in the same room
  as the enactor sees, and Averb is a list of commands that are run.
  These attributes may be set using the @<attribute> command, so the commands
  to set the attributes related to the 'drop' command are @drop, @odrop, and
  @adrop.

& WIZARDS
  Topic: WIZARDS
  
  There are various levels of wizards.  From GUILDMASTER to IMMORTAL.
   
  Wizards are the people that help run the game and make sure that everything
  is working properly.  They have special powers to tweak reality in ways
  mortals can only dream of.  Be nice to them, they are going out of their
  way to help keep the game running smoothly.
 
  At RhostMUSH there is an additional class of administrators.
  There are currently the following bit levels:
  
    Immortal, Royalty, Councilor, Architect, Guildmaster, Wanderer, Guest

& V()
  Function: v(<string>)
  The V function can be used as an alternative for percent (%) substitution
  and also as a replacement for get(me/<arg>).  If the argument is two
  characters long or longer and starts with a letter, then the object
  performing the v() call (and its parent, if necessary) is searched for the
  named attribute, and its value is returned if possible.  Otherwise, a
  percent substitution is performed on the argument (so that v(o) is
  equivalent to %o, for instance).  The percent form (%o in the previous
  example) is preferred as it is faster, and there are no longer any security
  problems associated with it.  Note that attributes with single-character
  names cannot be retrieved with v().  
  
  '#' will return the dbref# of the enactor, UNLESS there is a valid char
  after it in which it will attempt to pull the attribute.
  
  Do note that the '%' substitution for attributes only works for @va to @vz.
  
  Limitations:  v() can not call single-character attributes.  Use get() for
                any attribute with a single character.
  
  Notes: v() allows you to grab values past %9 without resorting to shift().
  
  Examples:
    > &# me=test
    Set
    > &#123 me=Test 2
    Set
    > say num(me)
    You say "#123"
    > say v(#)
    You say "#123"
    > say get(me/#)
    You say "test"
    > say v(#123)
    You say "Test 2"

& shuffle()
  Function: shuffle(<string> [,<delim> [,<output sep>]])
  
  Returns the string randomly 'shuffled' or mixed up with regards to order.
  You may specify an optional delimiter instead of the default 'space' as
  well as an optional filler.
  
  Example:
    > say shuffle(This is a test)
    You say "This a is test"               (seperator is a space ' ')
    > say shuffle(This is a test)
    You say "a test This is"
    > say shuffle(This@is@a@test,@)
    You say "is@a@This@test"               (seperator is a '@')
    > say shuffle(This@is@a@test,@,|)
    You say "This|test|a|is"               (seperator is '@', filler is '|')
  
  See Also: rand(), scramble(), sort(), setdiff(), setinter(), setunion() 
  
& scramble()
  Function:  scramble(<string>)
   
  This function scrambles a string, returning a random permutation of its
  characters. Note that this function does not pay any attention to spaces
  or other special characters; it will scramble these characters just like
  normal characters.
 
  Example:
    > say scramble(abcdef)
    You say "cfaedb"
 
  See Also:  shuffle(), garble()
  
& visible()
  Function:  visible(<victim>)
  
  Returns '1' if <victim> is visible by the enactor, '0' otherwise.
  
  Example:
    > say visible(thingy)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: visiblemux(), ishidden()
  
& visiblemux()
  Function:  visiblemux(<object>,<victim>[/<attr>])
   
  Returns 1 if <object> can examine <victim>, or 0 otherwise. If
  <object> or <victim> do not exist, 0 is returned.
 
  If an object-attribute pair is provided, 1 is returned if <object>
  can see <attr> on <victim>. If <attr> is not present on <victim>,
  1 is returned if <object> can examine <victim>.
  
  Examples:
    > say visiblemux(#1,me)
    You say "0"
    > say visiblemux(me,me)
    You say "1"
    > say visiblemux(me,me/desc)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: ishidden(), visible()
  
& default()
  Function:  default(<obj>/<attr>,<default case>)
 
  This function returns the value of <obj>/<attr>, as if retrieved via
  the get() function, if the attribute exists and is readable by you.
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that.
  Note that the default case is only evaluated if the attribute does
  not exist or cannot be read.
 
  This is useful for code that needs to return the value of an attribute,
  or an error message or default case, if that attribute does not exist.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=apple orange banana
    > say default(me/Test, No fruits!)
    You say "apple orange banana"
    > &TEST ME
    > say default(me/Test, No fruits!)
    You say "No fruits!"
 
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), u(), edefault(), u2(), ueval(), objeval()
 
& edefault()
  Function:  edefault(<obj>/<attr>,<default case>)
 
  This function returns the evaluated value of <obj>/<attr>, as if
  retrieved via the get_eval() function, if the attribute exists and
  is readable by you. Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and
  returns that. The default case is only evaluated if the attribute
  does not exist or cannot be read.
 
  Example:
    > &TEST me=You have lost [rand(10)] marbles.
    > say edefault(me/Test,You have no marbles.)
    You say "You have lost 6 marbles."
    > &TEST me
    > say edefault(me/Test,You have no marbles.)
    You say "You have no marbles."
  
  See Also:  get(), get_eval(), u(), default(), u2(), ueval(), objeval() 
  
& elements()
  Function: elements(<list of words>,<list of numbers>[[,<delim>][,<sep>]])
 
  This function returns the words in <list of words> that are in the
  positions specified by <list of numbers>. Optionally, a list delimiter
  other than a space can be separated.  This function does not assume a null
  to be a valid argument.  For that, use elementsmux().
 
  Examples:
    > say elements(Foo Ack Beep Moo Zot,2 4)
    You say "Ack Moo"
    > say elements(Foof|Ack|Beep|Moo,3 1,|)
    You say "Beep|Foof"
    > say elements(this is a test,2 4 2 2 2 2)
    You say "is test is is is is"
    > say elements(this@is@a@test,2 4 2 2 2 2,@)
    You say "is@test@is@is@is@is"
    > say elements(this@is@a@test,2 4 2 2 2 2,@,)
    You say "is test is is is is"
 
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), elementsmux()
  
& elementsmux()
  Function: elementsmux(<list of words>,<list of numbers>[[,<delim>][,<sep>]])
 
  This function returns the words in <list of words> that are in the
  positions specified by <list of numbers>. Optionally, a list delimiter
  other than a space can be separated.  This function assumes 'null' arguments
  are valid arguments while elements() does not.
 
  Examples:
    > say elementsmux(Foo Ack Beep Moo Zot,2 4)
    You say "Ack Moo"
    > say elementsmux(Foof|Ack|Beep|Moo,3 1,|)
    You say "Beep|Foof"
    > say elementsmux(this is a test,2 4 2 2 2 2)
    You say "is test is is is is"
    > say elementsmux(this@is@a@test,2 4 2 2 2 2,@)
    You say "is@test@is@is@is@is"
    > say elementsmux(this@is@a@test,2 4 2 2 2 2,@,)
    You say "is test is is is is"
 
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), elements()
  
  
& ZFUN()
  Function: zfun([<zone>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
   
  The zfun function (similiar to u()) evaluates an attribute, either from the 
  default zone of the object performing the function or from another zone you 
  control or pass the zonemaster lock on, passing in arguments and returning
  the result.
  
  When evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and
  not the 'calling' object, and 'me' refers to the object that supplied the
  attribute.  Check @list options to see if zfun and zfun2 functionality are
  switched.
   
  Examples:
    > @zone me=#2 (if #2 is a valid zonemaster that you can link to)
    > @va #2=Word is [extract(v(vb),add(%0,1),1)], arg2 is %1.
    > @vb me=This is a test of the zfun function.
    > say lzone(me)
    You say "#2"
    > say zfun(va,4,Testing 123)
    You say "Word is of, arg2 is Testing 123."
    > say zfun(va,7)
    You say "Word is function., arg2 is ."
    > say zfun(#2/va,6,Foobar)
    You say "Word is zfun, arg2 is Foobar."
  
  See Also: zfun2(), zfuneval(), zfundefault(), zfunldefault(), zfunlocal(),
            zemit(), @pemit
  
& ZFUN2()
  Function: zfun2([<zone>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
  
  This is nearly exactly like the original zfun() function except it parses
  in an object-dependant way like the old mushes.  It works by evaluating
  the function(s) by the power of the owner of the item it's on, and not
  by the power of the enactor.  
  
  This command is also very handy to keep security.
  
  For examples or more information, look at zfun()
  
  See Also: zfun(), zfun2local(), zfun2ldefault()
  
& zfun2default()
  Function:  zfun2default([<zone>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  Works like zfundefault() but uses the zfun2() function instead of zfun()
  
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <zone>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the zfun2() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say zfun2default(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say zfun2default(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also:  get(), get_eval(), zfun2(), zfundefault()
  
& u2default()
  Function:  u2default([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  Works like udefault() but uses the u2() function instead of u()
  
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the u2() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say u2default(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say u2default(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also:  get(), get_eval(), u2(), default(), edefault()
  
& zfundefault()
  Function:  zfundefault([<zone>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
   
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <zone>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the zfun() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
   
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
   
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say zfundefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say zfundefault(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
   
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), zfun(), zfundefault()
  
& udefault()
  Function:  udefault([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the u() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say udefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say udefault(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), u(), default(), edefault()
  
& zfunldefault()
  Function:  zfunldefault([<zone>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <zone>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the zfunlocal() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  Unlike zfundefault(), it doesn't clobber 
  %q0-%q9 registers.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say zfunldefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say zfunldefault(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), u(), default(), edefault()
  
& uldefault()
  Function:  uldefault([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the ulocal() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  Unlike udefault(), it doesn't clobber %q0-%q9
  registers.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say uldefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me
    > say uldefault(me/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), u(), default(), edefault()
  
& zfun2ldefault()
  Function:  zfun2ldefault([<zone>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <zone>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the u2local() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
 
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  Unlike zfun2default(), it doesn't clobber
  %q0-%q9 registers.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say zfun2ldefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)

  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the u2local() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.

  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  Unlike u2default(), it doesn't clobber
  %q0-%q9 registers.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say u2ldefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
    > &TEST me

    You say "-- BOOM --"
 
  See Also: get(), get_eval(), u(), default(), edefault()
  
& randpos()
  Function: randpos(<match>,<string>)
  
  This functions works like the totpos() function except the output is totally
  randomized.  It returns a random list of every position in the string
  <string> where pattern <match> is found.
  
  Example:
    > say randpos(i,this is weird)
    You say "6 3 11"
    > say randpos(i,this is weird)
    You say "11 6 3"
    > say randpos(z,this is weird)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: pos(), totpos(), numpos(), randmatch(), randextract()
  
& randmatch()
  Function: randmatch(<string>, <match>[, <delim>])
  
  This function resembles the totmatch() function except the output is totally
  randomized.  It returns a random list of every word match in string <string>
  from match <match>.  The match can have wildcards and an optional delimiter
  other than space may be specified.
  
  Example:
    > say randmatch(this test this this test,*this*)
    You say "3 1 4"
    > say randmatch(this test this this test,*this*)
    You say "4 3 1"
    > say randmatch(this@test@this@this@test,*this*,@)
    You say "3 4 1"
  
  See Also: match(), totmatch(), nummatch(), randpos(), randextract()
  
& pickrand()
& randextract()
  Function: randextract(<string>[, <numwords>, <delim>, <type>, <output sep>])
  
  The randextract() function is unique but somewhat similar to extract(). 
  The randextract() function takes <numwords> number of words from the string
  <string> and returns those words in random order.  You may specify an 
  optional delimiter <delim> other than a space (the default).  You may also 
  specify what <type> of randextract() you wish to perform.  The following 
  types exist.  You may specify an optional output seperator else it uses
  the same character as the delimiter.
      L - Grab given number of words lineally from the first random selection
      R - Grab <numwords> number of words but do not duplicate matches
      D - Grab <numwords> number of words and allow duplicate matches
  
  Example:
    > say randextract(this is a test,3)
    You say "this test a"
    > say randextract(this@is@a@test,3,@)
    You say "this@a@test"
    > say randextract(this is a test,3,,L,*)
    You say "this*is*a"
    > say randextract(this is a test,3,,R) (default)
    You say "this test a"
    > say randextract(this is a test,3,,D)
    You say "this a this"
  
  See Also: randpos(), randmatch(), extract(), extractword(), index(), rand()
  
& quota()
  Function: quota(<player>)
  
  The quota() function is used to see the total quota a given player has.
  It returns the same stats one would see with the @quota command.
  This works with both types of QUOTA systems.
  
  Example:
    > quota(me)
    You say "40 35 5"
  
  See Also: @quota, hasquota()
  
& hasquota()
  Function: hasquota(<player>,<amount>[,<type>])
  
  The hasquota() function returns a TRUE(1) or a FALSE(0) depending if the
  person has the specified amount <amount> of quota to actually be able to
  make the specified type (default is THING).  The types are the same types
  that the mush uses (THING (or object), PLAYER, EXIT, ROOM).  See help on
  type() for more information on types.  The hasquota() function works with
  both types of QUOTA systems.
  
  Example:
    > @quota me
    Quota for BiffStandard       Quota: 40     Used: 35     Remaining: 5
    > say hasquota(me,3)
    You say "1"
    > say hasquota(me,7)
    You say "0"
    > say hasquota(me,4,thing)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: quota(), @quota
  
& wordpos()
  Function: wordpos(<string>, <charpos>[, <delim>])
 
  Returns the number of the word within <string> where the character position
  <charpos> falls.  Spaces between words are treated as belonging to the word
  that follows them.  If <charpos> is not within the string, the value #-1 is
  returned.  Both words and characters are numbered starting at 1.
 
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
    > say wordpos(This is a test, 4)
    You say "1"
    > say wordpos(This is a test, 5)
    You say "2"
    > say wordpos(This is a test, 6)
    You say "2"
    > say wordpos(This is a test, 20)
    You say "#-1"
  
  See Also: words(), strlen()
  
& type()
  Function: type(<object>)
  Returns a string indicating the object type of <object>, either EXIT,
  PLAYER, ROOM, or THING.
 
  Example:
    > say type(me)
    You say "PLAYER"
    > say type(here)
    You say "ROOM"
  
  See Also: OBJECT TYPES
  
& hasflag()
  Function: hasflag(<object>[/<attribute>],<flag>)
  Returns true if object <object> has the flag named <flag> set on it.
  You may not be able to retrieve information for objects that you do not
  own.  You may also check if the given flag exists on the ATTRIBUTE.
  For the TYPE of the item, (P, E, R), you need to use hastype().
   
  Example:
    > say hasflag(me, wizard)
    You say "0"
    > say hasflag(me, connect) 
    You say "1"
    > say hasflag(me/desc, NOPROG)
    You say "1"
  
  NOPROG is how the MUSH internally recognizes the NO_COMMAND flag.
  Confusing, I know.  See 'help ATTRIBUTE FLAGS' on all of these flags.
  
  See Also: LIST FLAGS, ATTRIBUTE FLAGS, hastype()
  
& DELETE()
  Function: delete(<string>, <first>, <len> [,<key>])
  
  Returns <string>, but with <len> characters starting after the character
  at position <first> removed.  In other words, this function copies <first>
  characters, skips <len> characters, and then copies the remainder of the 
  string.
  
  You may specify a <key> of 1 to tell mid() to take the string raw and
  not do ansi-aware processing.  This will speed up the function.
  The default is '0' which does ansi processing.
  
  Note: the config param 'ansi_default' handles if the ansi handling is 
        configured default or not.  In which case the 'key' is reversed.
   
  Example:
    > say delete(abcdefgh, 3, 2)
    You say "abcfgh"
    > say delete(Would you like coffee or perhaps tea?, 15, 18)
    You say "Would you like tea?"
  
  See Also: ldelete(), mid(), replace(), remove()
  
& userlocks
  Userlocks are created, viewed, and checked by utilizing three functions.
  
    lockencode(<string>) --------- this will encode the lock key 
                                   (any valid key) into a 64 byte encoding 
                                   (like mime encapsulation) that you can 
                                   then store pretty much anywhere that you 
                                   want.
  
    lockdecode(<string>) --------- this will decode the specified encoded key
                                   value into the human-readable lock format. 
                                   The output will be the same as if you did 
                                   a lock() on a @lock.
  
    lockcheck(<string>,target>) -- this will compare the 64 byte encoded lock
                                   against the specified target.  It returns
                                   a '1' for success or a '0' for failure. 
                                   This works like elock() on a @lock.
  
  See Also: lockencode(), lockdecode(), lockcheck(), lock(), elock(), @lock

& lockencode()
& lockdecode()
& lockcheck()
  Function: lockencode(<string>)
            lockdecode(<string>)
            lockcheck(<string>,<target>)
  
  lockencode() returns an encoded string of a boolean lock evaluation.
   
  lockdecode() returns the decoded string of the encoded boolean.
  
  lockcheck() returns boolean true(1)/false(0) based on the encoded boolean.
  
  This is the same value (though encoded) that would be set when you issue
  a @Lock on something.  This is useful if you wish to enbed lock values
  in any string or value that you wish to then decrypt at any given time.
  
  lockcheck() follows the same rules that elock() would return.
  
  Example:
    > say name(me)
    You say "Bob"
    > say lockencode(me&*tester)
    You say "KCMxMjM0KSYoIzkwMSk="
    > say lockdecode(KCMxMjM0KSYoIzkwMSk=)
    You say "*Bob&*Tester
    > say lockcheck(KCMxMjM0KSYoIzkwMSk=,me)
    You say "1"
    > say lockcheck(KCMxMjM0KSYoIzkwMSk=,*Guest)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lockdecode(), lockdecode(), lockcheck(), lock(), elock(), @lock

& lock()
  Function: lock(<object>[/<whichlock>][,<key>][,<attribute>])
 
  Returns the named lock on <object>.  If you don't specify the lock to get,
  the default lock is returned.  You must control <object>.
  
  If side-effects are enabled, it will set the specified lock, otherwise it
  will return an error.   The keys used are the same as in 'help @lock'
  The SIDEFX flag is required to use the side-effect portion of lock().
  
  Type @list options to see if the side-effect portion of lock() is enabled.
  
  If <attribute> is specified, then if <key> is non-null, the attribute 
  specified by <attribute> is 'locked'.  If <key> is empty, then the attribute
  specified by <attribute> is 'unlocked'.

  Example:
    > say lock(me)
    You say "*TinyPlayer"
    > say lock(me,#0)
    You say ""
    > say lock(me)
    You say "#0"
    > say lock(me,yes,va)
    You say "Attribute locked."
  
  See Also: @lock, elock(), lockencode(), lockdecode(), lockcheck()
  
& elock()
  Function: elock(<object>[/<whichlock>],<victim>)
  Checks if <victim> would pass the named lock on <object>.  Only the object's
  owner may test locks other than the default lock.
  
  Example:
    > @lock me/page=!*Twinklock
      Set.
    > say elock(me/pagelock,*twink)
      You say "0"
    > @unlock me/page
      Set.
    > say elock(me/pagelock,*twink)
      You say "1"
  
  See Also: @lock, lock(), lockencode(), lockdecode(), lockcheck()
  
& LWHO()
  Function: lwho([[<value>], [<target>]])
  Returns a list of the db numbers of connected players.  This returns what
  a 'WHO' or 'DOING' would return.  This takes an optional type value.
  '0' is the default, and '1' returns the player list in the form dbref:port.
  '2' will return just the ports.
  
  Note: You can only see your own port(s) unless you're a wizard.  Any other
        port will return '-1'.
  
  An optional target is allowed if you control (are a higher bitlevel) than
  the target to specify how lwho() would look per the target's viewpoint.
   
  Example:
    > WHO
    Player Name          On For Idle  Doing
    Mortal                00:11   0s  
    Evinar                00:12   6m  
    Wizard                00:32   6s  
    3 Players logged in.
    > say lwho()
    You say "#226 #271 #1"
    > say lwho(0)
    You say "#226 #271 #1"
    > say lwho(1)
    You say "#226:20 #271:5 #1:6"
  
  See Also: WHO, DOING, conn(), idle()
 
& ALIGN()
  RhostMUSH has no built in align(). 
  
  See 'help printf()'

& PRINTF()
  Function: printf(<format string>,<arg1> [,<arg2>, ..., <argN>])
  
  The printf() function is used to format a string by using substitutions
  with the convenience of centering, justifying, and wrapping the text
  based on various parameters.
  
  ALL AVAILABLE CODES:  help printf codelist  (very handy!)
  FORMAT SYNTAX:        help printf syntax
  EXAMPLES:             help printf examples
                        help printf penn      (for penn align-like examples)
  
  See Also: center(), just(), rjust(), rjc(), ljc(), wrap(), columns(), 
            wrapcolumns(), array()

& PRINTF CODELIST
  Function: printf(<format string>,<arg1> [,<arg2>, ..., <argN>])
  
  The following codelists are available for printf.  The syntax of
  a codelist format is in the form:  $<code><value>s.  The '$' specifies
  that a printf-recognized format is to be used.  the 's' specifies that
  the string in the argument is to be inserted at that location.
  
  Valid format strings: (syntax: $<code><value>s)
      Key Fields:
         $ - specifies to tell printf() to start/initiate the format.
         s - specifies the location of a string substitution for formatting.
      Code Fields: 
         ! - do not display value if null
         - - left justify (right is default)
         ^ - center justify
         _ - stretch justify
         + - do not cut value if exceed value (default is cut off)
         & - process carrage returns and keep in same column field.  This
             will break up lines based on carrage returns (%r) and keep
             formatted into the same column specified in the format.
         | - automatically format the text and insert carrage returns
             at the specified padding field.  This does auto wrapping
             like the '&' option without the need for carrage returns.
         " - When used in junction with '|' it will try to split columns
             on the first whitespace instead of always at width.
         ' - If specified on a field, and that column is empty, the 
             column to the RIGHT is shifted to the LEFT.  All formatting
             remains the same for the original columns.
         ` - If specified on a field, and that column is empty, the
             column to the LEFT is shifted to the RIGHT.  All formatting
             remains the same for the original columns.
         : - will specify filler characters for what is between the ::'s.
             If the string starts with '!', any blank lines will have a
             space filler.  You must specify two ':'s for begining/end tags.
               examples: :.:  -- fill with a single '.'
                         :!.: -- fill with a single '.' on non-blank lines.
                         :[ansi(hg,.,hb,.)]: -- fill with multi-color.
         / - The numerical value specified between /<number>/ will be used
             as a cut-off value when using the '|' wrap option.  
               examples: /10/ -- when using '|' cut off after 10 characters.
             Valid values: 0-3998 (0 is unlimited)
      Value fields:
         1-3000 - format value to padd
         0 - if prepending a number, tells it to padd 0's.
  
  Note: The ` and ' code fields won't work on single line columns.
   
  See Also: center(), just(), rjust(), rjc(), ljc(), wrap(), columns()
  
& PRINTF SYNTAX 
  Function: printf(<format string>,<arg1> [,<arg2>, ..., <argN>])
  
  The printf function requires the following syntax.  It requires the start
  of a formatted string with a '$' and the end of a formatted string with
  an 's' that tells printf that it will substitute that with an argument.
  
  Note: The syntax always must start with a '$' and end with a 's'.
  
  The order of all the various formatting fields (including the number
  used for padding) may be in any order.
  
  Syntax examples:
      printf($10s $10s $10s,arg1,arg2,arg3) # padd 10, right just
      printf($10s,arg1)                     # padd 10, right just
      printf($10s boo $10s, arg1, arg2)     # padd 10, right just
      printf($-10s boo $10s, arg1, arg2)    # padd 10, left just
      printf($10^s boo $10s, arg1, arg2)    # padd 10, center just
      printf($10&-s boo $10s, arg1, arg2)   # padd 10, left just, CR wrap

& PROGRAMMER()
  Function: programmer(<player>)
  Returns the dbref# of the enactor who placed the target player inside a
  program.  If the target player is not in a program, or if you do not
  have access to check the information, it returns '#-1'.
  
  Examples:
    > say %#
    You say "#123"
    > say inprogram(me)
    You say "0"
    > @va me=@emit You entered %0!
    Set.
    > @program me=me/va:Start Program...
    Start Program...
    > |say inprogram(me)
    You say "1"
    > |say programmer(me)
    You say "#123"
    > |@quitprogram
    @program cleared.
  
  See Also: @program, @quitprogram, programmer()
  
& INPROGRAM()
  Function: inprogram(<player>)
  Returns a TRUE (1) value if the player is currently inside a @program,
  otherwise it returns a FALSE (0) value.  If the player is invalid, it
  returns a '#-1'.
  
  Examples:
    > say inprogram(me)
    You say "0"
    > @va me=@emit You entered %0!
    Set.
    > @program me=me/va:Start Program...
    Start Program...
    > |say inprogram(me)
    You say "1"
    > |@quitprogram
    @program cleared.
  
  See Also: @program, @quitprogram, programmer()
  
& INZONE()
  Function: inzone(<zone>)
  Returns the rooms in the specified zonemaster.  If the target is not a
  zonemaster, or if the object is not a valid zone, it returns an empty
  list.  This is _not_ database intensive.
  
  Example:
    > @set here=zonemaster
    > @zone here=#0   (a room)
    > @zone here=#534 (a room)
    > @zone here=#987 (a player)
    > say lzone(here)
    You say "#0 #534 #987"
    > say inzone(here)
    You say "#0 #534"
  
  See Also: @zone, ZONES, lzone(), zwho()
  
& ZWHO()
  Function: zwho(<zone> [,<type>])
  Returns the players in the specified zonemaster.  If the target is not
  a zonemaster, or if the object is not a valid zone, it returns an
  empty list.  This is _not_ database intensive.  This is the default 
  <type> '0'.
  
  If you specify <type> '1' for the zwho(), it lists all players that reside
  inside every single location belonging to that zone.  Also not overly
  cost intensive.
  
  Example:
    > @set here=zonemaster
    > @zone here=#0   (a room)
    > say lcon(#0,player)
      You say "#1 #3 #5"
    > @zone here=#534 (a room)
    > @zone here=#987 (a player)
    > say lzone(here)
    You say "#0 #534 #987"
    > say zwho(here)
    You say "#987"
    > say zwho(here,1)
    You say "#1 #3 #5"
  
  See Also: @zone, ZONES, lzone(), inzone()
  
& LZONE()
  Function: lzone(<object> [,<key>])
  Returns the zone list for an object. If the object is a zonemaster,
  the list contains the objects within the zone controlled by the 
  zonemaster. If the object is not a zonemaster, the list contains
  all of the zonemasters that the object belongs to.  This is _not_
  database intensive.
  
  The following optional keys are available:
    0 - list all zones (or zonemasters) of the target (default)
    n - List 'n'th 400 zones (or zonesmasters) of the target. 
        NOTE: 'n' will be any number from 1 to however many 'pages'
              So '1' would be first 400, '2' would be second 400, etc.
    l - List total pages and total zones (or zonemasters) of target.
    ~ - [~#1-#2] list zones starting at #1 until count of #2.
     
  Example:
    > @set here=zonemaster
    > @zone here=#0
    > @zone here=#534
    > say lzone(here)         
    You say "#0 #534"
    > say lzone(here,l)
    You say "1 2"
 
  See Also: @zone, ZONES, inzone(), zwho()
 
& OBJ()
  Function: obj(<object>)
   
  Returns the proper objective pronoun (him, her, it, them) for referring to
  <object>, based on the object's Sex attribute.  You must either control
  or be near <object>.
  
  Example:
    > @sex me=male
    Set.
    > say obj(me)
    You say "him"
   
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS, poss(), subj(), aposs()
  
& POSS()
  Function: poss(<object>)
 
  Returns the proper possessive pronoun (his, her, its, their) for referring
  to <object>, based on the object's Sex attribute.  You must either control
  or be near <object>.
  
  Example:
    > @sex me=male
    Set.
    > say poss(me)
    You say "his"
    
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS, obj(), subj(), aposs()
  
& ARRAY()
  Function: array(<string>, <register count>, <width> [[,<delim> [,<type>]])
  
  This function will take an input string and split it out, based on width,
  rounding to the first viable word (if possible) and spit it out into setq
  registers based on the number of registers you wish to split it in based
  on <register count>.  Registers start from 0-9 then go to a-z.  Registers
  are cleared automatically before being utilized.
  
  You may specify an optional delimiter.  By default, it takes any white
  space.  You may optionally specify the type.  A type of '1' will take
  the virtual register count down then over.  The default '0' does it
  in a normal sequential order.
  
  If you specify width of '0' and specify a delimeter, then it will ignore
  width of the values and split the array based on the delimiter only.
  
  If you wish to store the setq registers prior to this function, please
  utilize the pushregs() function to back-up your registers.
  
  This function is ansi aware. 
  
  Examples:
    > think array(abcdefghij,2,2)%q0
    ab
    ef
    ij

    > think array(abcdefgh,2,2)%q1
    cd
    eh

    > think array(abcdefghij,2,2,,1)%q0
    ab
    cd
    ef

    > think array(abcdefghij,2,2,,1)%q1
    gh
    ij
  
  See Also: printf(), setq(), setr(), r(), substitutions

& APOSS()
  Function: aposs(<object>)
 
  Returns the proper absolute possessive pronoun (his, hers, its, theirs) for
  referring to <object>, based on the object's Sex attribute.  You must either
  control or be near <object>.
  
  Example:
    > @sex me=male
    Set.
    > say aposs(me)
    You say "his"
   
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS, obj(), subj(), poss()
  
& SUBJ()
  Function: subj(<object>)
 
  Returns the proper subjective pronoun (he, she, it, they) for referring to
  <object>, based on the object's Sex attribute.  You must either control
  or be near <object>.
  
  Example:
    > @sex me=male
    Set.
    > say subj(me)
    You say "he"
   
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS, obj(), poss(), aposs()
  
& @sql
  Command: @sql <query>
   
  This command issues an SQL query if the MUSH supports SQL and can connect 
  to an SQL server. You must be wizard/immortal to use @sql.
   
  Generally, the sql() function is more useful for coding, as it delimits its
  return values, but @sql is handy for INSERT-type queries and quick checks. 
  If you pass arbitrary data to @sql, be sure you call sqlescape() on it; 
  see the example in help sql().
   
  Example:
    > @sql SHOW TABLES
   
  See also: sql(), @sqlconnect, @sqldisconnect, sqlon(), sqloff(),
            sqlescape(), sqlping()


& @sqlconnect
  Command: @sqlconnect
  
  This attempts to establish an SQL connection to the remote MySQL database.
  Only wizards+ can use this feature.
  
  Example:
    > @sqlconnect
  
  See Also: sqlon(), @sqldisconnect, sqloff(), @sql, sql(), sqlescape(),
      sqlping()

& @sqldisconnect
  Command: @sqldisconnect
  
  This attempts to close an SQL connection to the remote MySQL database.
  Only wizards+ can use this feature.
  
  Example:
    > @sqldisconnect
  
  See Also: sqloff(), @sqlconnect, sqlon(), @sql, sql(), sqlescape()

& SQL()
  Function: sql(<SQL statement> [,<delim>,[<field delim>]])
            sqlescape(<SQL statement>
   
  This function sends a SQL statement to an external SQL database and
  returns the results. The user must be wizard or immortal.  On failure,
  or a problem with executing the SQL statement, the function returns #-1.
   
  If multiple rows are returned, each row will be delimited by <delim>;
  if <delim> is not specified, a space will be used. If multiple fields
  are returned, each field will be delimited by <field delim> if specified,
  or <delim> if not, or a space by default.
   
  Please not that special characters to mush (%, {, }, [, ], (, ), \) may
  have to be escaped for use in queries.  Please use ' for quotes for fields.
  Only wizards+ can use this feature.

  Examples: (borrowed from TinyMUSH3's help file)
  > @sql SELECT player_name, dbref_num FROM test WHERE race='Vampire'
  Row 1, Field 1: Nos
  Row 1, Field 2: 4
  Row 2, Field 1: Caine
  Row 2, Field 2: 389
  > &VAMPS me = SELECT player_name, dbref_num FROM test WHERE race='Vampire'
                ORDER BY player_name
  > say [sql(v(VAMPS))] -- [sql(v(VAMPS),|)]
  You say "Caine 389 Nos 4 -- Caine|389|Nos|4"
  > @sql UPDATE test SET race='Vampire' WHERE dbref_num=672
  SQL query touched 1 row.
  > say [sql(v(VAMPS),|,)] -- [sql(v(VAMPS),|,/)]
  You say "Caine 389|Nos 4|Rufus 672 -- Caine/389|Nos/4|Rufus/672"
  
  See Also: sqlescape(), @sql, sqlon(), sqloff(), @sqlconnect, @sqldisconnect,
            sqlping()

& SQLESCAPE()
  Function: sqlescape(<string>)
  
  This function performs SQL-server-implemented escaping of <string>. It's
  important to escape arbitrary data before passing it to the sql() function,
  or @sql command, to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   
  When used in an SQL query, the results of an sqlescape() function
  should be enclosed in single quotes.
   
  Note: You must be a wizard (or higher) to utilize this function.
  
  Example:
    > say sqlescape(You don't say)
    You say "You don\'t say"
  
  See Also: sql(), @sql, sqlon(), sqloff(), @sqlconnect, @sqldisconnect,
            sqlping()

& SQLON()
  Function: sqlon()
  
  This function is essentially just the function equivelant of @sqlconnect.
  Only wizards+ can use this feature.
  
  Example:
    > say sqlon()
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: @sqlconnect, sqloff(), @sqldisconnect, @sql, sql(), sqlescape(),
            sqlping()

& SQLOFF()
  Function: sqloff()
  
  This function is essentially just the function equivelant of @sqlconnect.
  Only wizards+ can use this feature.
  
  Example:
    > say sqloff()
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: @sqlconnect, sqloff(), @sqldisconnect, @sql, sql(), sqlescape(),
            sqlping()

& SQLPING()
  Function: sqlping()
  
  This function returns '0' if the database is alive and active, or non-zero
  (usually '1') if the database has an error with connectivity.
  
  Example:
    > say sqlping()
    You say "0"
    
  See Also: @sqlconnect, sqloff(), @sqldisconnect, @sql, sql(), sqlescape(),
            sqlon()

& SQLITE_QUERY()
  Function: sqlite_query(<db>,<query>[,<cdel>[,<rdel>[,<arg1>,...,<argN>]]])
  
  This function executes the given query on a SQLite database. The database is
  automatically created when necessary, so no additional set-up is needed to
  begin using SQLite. The default column delimiter is '|', and the default row
  delimiter is '^'.
  
  Note that SQL statements often contain characters like ',', '(', or ')', so
  it can be particularly helpful to save queries in an attribute and use V()
  or U() to access them.
  
  Since sqlite_query supports parameterized queries, this is even easier. The
  second INSERT statement below demonstrates parameterized queries. One
  important note is that the column and row delimiter arguments are still
  required for all queries, even though they are only used for queries that
  return data, such as SELECT queries.
  
  The arguments are the <db> [dbname], <query> [database query], 
  <cdel> [column delimiter], <rdel> [row delimiter], and <arg1> through <argN>
  which are the parameters.

  Function: sqlite_query(<db>,<query>[,<cdel>[,<rdel>[,<arg1>,...,<argN>]]])
  
  Example:
    > @va me = CREATE TABLE test ( testFieldA STRING, testFieldB STRING )
    Set.
    > say sqlite_query( testdb, v(va) )
    You say ""
    > @va me = INSERT INTO test VALUES ( 'a', 'b' )
    Set.
    > say sqlite_query( testdb, v(va) )
    You say ""
    > say sqlite_query( testdb, SELECT * FROM test )
    You say "a|b"
    > @va me = INSERT INTO test VALUES ( ?, ? )
    Set.
    > say sqlite_query( testdb, v(va), , , c, d )
    You say ""
    > say sqlite_query( testdb, SELECT * FROM test )
    You say "a|b^c|d"
  
  See Also: @cluster 

& SQUISH()
  Function squish(<string>[,<delimeter>])
  
  This function will remove multiple spaces (or specified delimiter) from
  the string.  This is meant for the ability to remove excess spaces from
  strings.
  
  Examples:
    > @wait 0=@va me=Test[space(20)]Test
    Set.
    > say v(va)
    You say "Test                    Test"
    > say squish(v(va))
    You say "Test Test"
    > @vb me=TestaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaTest
    Set.
    > say v(vb)
    You say "TestaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaTest"
    > say squish(v(vb),a)
    You say "TestaTest"

& NEARBY()
  Function: nearby(obj1,obj2)
 
  Tests if obj1 is near obj2 (if it is in the same location, in obj2's
  inventory, or is obj2's location).  You must control either obj1 or obj2, or
  be near either one of them, if both of these tests fail then 0 is returned.
  This function returns 1 if the two objects are nearby and 0 if not.
  
  Example:
    > look
    Test Room
    This is a test room.
    Contents:
    ObjectThingy
    Obvious exits:
    North <N>  South <S>
    > say nearby(me, objectthingy)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: @whereis, @whereall, loc(), room()
  
& GET()
  Function: get(<object>/<attribute>)
 
  The get function fetches the specified attribute from the named object.
  It can be used to get attributes from objects you own, public and visual
  attributes of objects near you, and public and visual attributes other
  than the description of players wherever they may be.  If the attribute is
  not present on <object>, its parent is searched for the attribute.
 
  Example:
    > read me
    > say get(me/desc)
  
  See Also: get_eval(), u(), xget()
  
& GET_EVAL()
  Function: get_eval(<object>/<attribute>)
 
  The get_eval function returns the specified attribute from the named object
  (just like the get function), except that function references and
  %-substitutions have already been performed.  In function references, 
  'me' refers to the object being looked at, and %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, etc) refer to the object making the get_eval
  call.  If the attribute is not present on <object>, its parent is searched
  for the attribute.
 
  Example:
    > @va test = This is a get_eval test on %n.  The vb is [get(me/vb)]
    > @vb test = VB from test
    > @vb me = VB from me
    > say get(test/va)
    You say "This is a get_eval test on %n. The vb is [get(me/vb)]"
    > say get_eval(test/va)
    You say "This is a get_eval test on Foobar. The vb is VB from test"
  
  See Also: get(), u()
  
& T()
  Function: t(<string>)
  
  Returns a '0' if the string is null (empty), a '0', or a # followed by any
  negative number, or a string containing nothing but spaces.  
  Otherwise, it returns a '1'.
  
  Example:
    > say t()
    You say "0"
    > say t(0)
    You say "0"
    > say t(#-1)
    You say "0"
    > say t(900)
    You say "1"
    > say t(this is a test)
    You say "1"
    > say t(space(100))
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: isdbref(), isspace(), s()
  
& MIX()
  Function: mix([<object>/]<attribute>,<list 1>,<list 2>[,<list N>][,<delim>])
  
  This function is similiar to map(), except it takes the arguments in the 
  lists and passes them into the attribute as %0 (for list1), %1 (for list2),
  up to %9 (for list9).  <delim> is used as the delimiter to seperate items
  in each of the lists.  If the number of lists is 2, the delimiter may be
  optional, otherwise you are forced to provide a delimiter.  If no delimiter
  is specified, it's defaulted as a space but only for the above condition.
  The lists do NOT have to have the same number of elements.
  
  Examples:
    > &do_math me=[add(%0,%1)]
    > &do_moremath me=[add(%0,%1,%2,%3,%4,%5,%6,%7,%8,%9)]
    > say mix(do_math,1 2 3 4 5,2 4 6 8 10)
    You say "3 6 9 12 15"
    > say mix(do_math,1@2@3@4@5,2@4@6@8@10,@)
    You say "3@6@9@12@15"
    > say mix(do_math,1 2 3 4 5,7 9)
    You say "8 11 3 4 5"
    > say mix(do_moremath,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 8,9 10 11 12,)
    You say "37 18 11 12"

& TIME()
  Function: time()
 
  Gives you the current time.
  WARNING!  This is the time on the machine that the mud is running on, and
  not where you are.
 
  Example:
    > say time()
    You say "Thu Dec 19 09:48:06 1991"

  from the string.  
  
  Example:
    > say right(this is a test,5)
    You say " test"
    > say right(this is a test,10000)
    You say "this is a test"

  from the string.
  
  Example:
    > say left(this is a test,5)
    You say "this "
    > say left(this is a test,10000)
    You say "this is a test"
    > say left(this is a test,0)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: right(), mid(), delete(), ljc(), rjc()
  
& RAND()
  Function: rand(<num>[,,<boolean>])
            rand(<min>,<max>[,<boolean>])
 
  Rand returns an integer between 0 and num-1.
  
  You may optionally specify a min/max pair of where the random number 
  will range between.
  
  If you specify the boolean, it will return the value as a double.  
  Max double is 100 digits.
 
  Example:
    > say rand(10)
    You say "6"
    > say rand(10)
    You say "1"
    > say rand(10)

  See Also: randextract(), randpos(), randmatch()
  
& EE()
  ee(<number> [, <precision>])
  
  The ee() function turns the number into an engineering value based on
  the specified precision.  If no precision is given, it defaults to 2.
  
  Example:
    say ee(123456789012345)
    You say "1.23E+14"
  
  See Also: mul(), fdiv(), strmath()

& ENTRANCES()
  entrances([<object> [,<type> [,<begin> [,<end>]]]])
   
  With no arguments, the entrances() function returns a list of all
  exits, things, players, and rooms linked to your location, like
  @entrances. You can specify an object other than your current location
  with <object>. You can limit the type of objects found by specifying
  <type> as follows:
        a        all (default)
        e        exits
        t        things
        p        players
        r        rooms
  You can also limit the range of the dbrefs searched by giving <begin>
  and <end>.  This function is computationally expensive and costs the same
  as @find. 
  
  Example:
    > say entrances(here) 
    You say "#123 #456"
  
  See Also: @entrances, lrooms(), lexits(), lcon() 
  
& EVAL()
  Function: eval(<string>)
            eval(<object>,<attribute>)
  
  The first form of this function will evaluate the passed string.  All 
  substitutions are evaluated and functions called with proper permissions.
  
  The second form of this function works similiar to the get_eval() function.
  
  Examples:
    > say eval(1 plus 1 equals [add(1,1)])
    You say "1 plus 1 equals 2"
    > @va me=1+1=[add(1,1)]
    Set.
    > say eval(me,va)
    You say "1+1=2"
  
  See Also: s(), get_eval(), get(), u(), u2(), zfun()
  
& EXIT()
  Function: exit(<object>)
 
  Exit returns the first exit on the list of exits in the object.  Dark exits
  are not listed, unless you own the object.  Unlike LEXITS(), this function
  does not provide information about exits in parent objects.
  
  Example:
    > say exit(here)
    You say "#123"
   
  See Also: con(), lcon(), lexits(), next()
  
& ABS()
  Function: abs(<number>)
 
  Returns the absolute value of its argument.
  <number> may be a floating point number, and a floating point result
  is returned.
 
  Examples:
    > say abs(4)
    You say "4"
    > say abs(-4)
    You say "4"
    > say abs(0)
    You say "0"
   
  See Also: sign()
 
& ALPHAMIN()
  Function: alphamin(<word1>, <word2>, <word3>, ...)
  Takes up to ten word arguments, and returns the word which is
  lexicographically smallest.
  
  Example:
    > say alphamin(this,those,these)
    You say "this"
  
  See Also: alphamax(), min(), max()
  
& ALPHAMAX()
  Function: alphamax(<word1>, <word2>, <word3>, ...)
  Takes up to ten word arguments, and returns the word which is
  lexicographically biggest.
  
  Example:
    > say alphamax(this,thix,thiz)
    You say "thiz"
  
  See Also: alphamin(), min(), max()
  
  
& MAX()
  Function: max(<number1>,<number2>[,<numberN]...)
   
  Returns the largest integer from among its arguments.
  Up to 30 arguments may be specified.
  
  Numbers may be floating point numbers, and a floating point result
  is returned.
   
  Examples:
    > say max(2,4)
    You say "4"
    > say max(-100,50,0,25)
    You say "50"
   
  See Also: min(), alphamin(), alphamax()
  
& MIN()
  Function: min(<number1>,<number2>[,<numberN]...)
   
  Returns the smallest integer from among its arguments.
  Up to 30 arguments may be specified.
  <numberN> may be a floating point number, and a floating point result
  is returned.
 
  Examples:
    > say min(2,4)
    You say "2"
    > say min(-100,50,0,25)
    You say "-10"
   
  See Also: max(), alphamin(), alphamax()
  
& ADD()
  Function: add(<number1>,<number2>[,<numberN>]...)
   
  Returns the result of adding its arguments together.
  You may add up to 30 numbers in one add() call.
  
  Numbers may be floating point numbers, and a floating point result
  is returned.
   
  Example:
    > say add(2,4)
    You say "6"
    > say add(5,3,7,-4)
    You say "11"
  
  See Also: div(), mod(), mul(), sub()
  
& SUB()
  Function: sub(<number1>,<number2>[,<numberN>]...)
   
  Returns the result of subtracting <number2> from <number1>.
  The numbers may be floating point numbers, and a floating point result
  is returned.  
   
  Numbers may be floating point numbers, and a floating point result
  is returned.
   
  Example:
    > say sub(5,2)
    You say "3"

& MODIFYTIME()
  Function: modifytime(<target>)
  
  This function returns the last time the target was modified.  This only
  looks at attributes and not flags being set/removed.  You must be able
  to examine the object to get the attribute.
  
  Example:
    > say modifytime(me)
    You say "Mon Jul 15 17:16:20 2000"
  
  See Also: createtime()
  
& CREATETIME()
  Function: createtime(<target>)
  
  This function returns the time the target was created.  You must be able
  to examine the object to get the attribute.
  
  Example:
    > say createtime(me)
    You say "Mon Jul 14 12:23:17 2000"
  
  See Also: modifytime()
  
& MODULO()
  Function: modulo(<integer1>,<integer2>[,<integerN>]...)
   
  Returns the modulo from <integer1> and <integer2>.
  
  You may specify more than two values.
   
  Example:
    > say mod(13,-3)
    You say "1"
    > say modulo(13,-3)
    You say "-2"
  
  See Also: add(), fdiv(), div(), mul(), round(), sub(), trunc()
  
& REMAINDER()
  Function: remainder(<integer1>,<integer2>[,<integerN>]...)
  
  Returns the integer remainder from dividing <integer1> by <integer2>.
  This could be aliased to either modulo() or remainder().  To see
  which, do: think mod()
  
  You may specify more than two values.
   
  Example:
    > say remainder(15,3)
    You say "0"
    > say remainder(16,3)
    You say "1"
    > say remainder(17,3)
    You say "2"
    > say remainder(18,3)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: add(), fdiv(), div(), mul(), round(), sub(), trunc()
   
& MOD()
  Function: mod(<integer1>,<integer2>[,<integerN>]...)
   
  Returns the integer remainder from dividing <integer1> by <integer2>.
  This could be aliased to either modulo() or remainder().  To see
  which, do: think mod()
  
  You may specify more than two values.
   
  Example:
    > say mod(15,3)

& FMOD()
  Function: fmod(<double1>,<double2>[,<doubleN>]...)
   
  Returns the floating remainder from dividing <double1> by <double2>.
  This works just like mod(), except it takes floating point numbers
  instead of integers.
  
  You may specify more than two values.
   
  Example:
    > say fmod(15.1,3.1)
    You say "2.7"
    > say fmod(16.1,3.1)
    You say "0.6"
    > say fmod(17.1,3.1)
    You say "1.6"
    > say fmod(18.1,3.1)
    You say "2.6"
  
  See Also: add(), fdiv(), div(), mul(), round(), sub(), trunc(), mod()
  
& DIST2D()
  Function: dist2d(x1, y1, x2, y2)
   
  Returns the integer distance between the Cartesian points in two dimensions
  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).

  See Also: dist3d()
  
& DIST3D()
  Function: dist3d(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)
   
  Returns the integer distance between the Cartesian points in three
  dimensions (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2).
   
  Example:
    > say dist3d(0,0,0,10,15,20)
    You say "27"
  
  See Also: dist2d()
  
& FIRST()
  Function: first(<string>[, <delim>])
 
  Returns the first word of a string, that is, everything to the left
  of the first space in the string, or the entire string if there are
  no spaces in the string.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a word delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
    > say first(This is a test)
    You say "This"
    > say first(Would you like coffee, or perhaps tea)
    You say "Would"
    > say first(List&with&nonstandard&delimiters,&)
    You say "List"
  
  See Also: rest(), before(), after(), extract(), extractword()
  
& REMIT()
  Function: remit(<list of locations>,<string> [,<to-reality-toggle>])
  
  The remit() side-effect function is used to emit the given <string> to every
  location specified in the <list of locations>.
  
  This works similarilly to @pemit/list/contents.
  
  This function relies on the config parameter 'pemit_any_object' to
  be enabled to allow remitting to any room, otherwise, it will only
  work on rooms you control.
  
  This side-effect must be enabled (@list options to see if it is) before it
  can be used.  Anything using it must have the SIDEFX flag set.
   
  If the <to-reality-toggle> is set to '1', then it assumes the remit is
  a 'to-reality' model, in which the <list of locations> takes the form:
  
       reality1 reality2 ... realityN/location1 location2 ... locationN
 
  Example:
    > say remit(here #0,Boo)
    Boo
    You say ""
    > say remit(real umbra/here #0,Boo,1)
    Boo
    You say ""
  
  This would have emitted 'Boo' to your current location and to #0 (if you had
  control of the room).
  
  See Also: @pemit, @emit
  
& REST()
  Function: rest(<string>[, <delim>])
 
  The rest function takes a string, returns all the string except the first
  word, that is, everything to the right of the first space, or an empty 
  string, or the empty string if there are no spaces in the string.  
 
  <delim> may be used to specify a word delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
    > say rest(This is a test) 
    You say "is a test"
    > say rest(Would you like coffee, or perhaps tea) 
    You say "you like coffee, or perhaps tea"
    > say rest(List!with!different!delimiters,!)
    You say "with!different!delimiters"
  
  See Also: first(), before(), after(), extract(), extractword()
  
& STRCAT()
  Function: strcat(<string>[,<string2>,...,<stringx>])
  
  Returns the strings concatinated with no spaces between them.
  
  Example:
    > say strcat(this,is,a,test)
    You say "thisisatest"
    > say strcat(one,2,three,4)
    You say "one2three4"
  
  See Also: cat()
  
& STRLEN()
& STRLENVIS()
& STRLENRAW()
  Function: strlen(<string>)
            strlenvis(<string>)
            strlenraw(<string>)
 
  Returns the number of characters in <string>.
 
  Example:
    > say strlen(This is a test)
    You say "14"
    > say strlen(Would you like coffee, or perhaps tea)
    You say "37"
  
  The strlenvis() function adjusts the string to the VISUAL size of
  the string when using chr() codes (which are normally 6 characters each).
  This is so you can specially padd when using special chr() values.
  
  The strlenraw() function displays the raw length of the string, including
  any 'markup' codes that are generally used for accents and raw ansi.  This
  is mostly intended when you need to see the absolute length of a string
  for length checks or the like.
    
  See Also: words(), wordpos()
  
& MID()
  Function: mid(<string>, <first>, <length> [,<key>])
 
  Mid returns a segment of the string, the <length> characters to the
  right of the <first> character.  Note that the first character in a
  string is numbered zero, and not one.
  
  You may specify a <key> of 1 to tell mid() to take the string raw and
  not do ansi-aware processing.  This will speed up the function.
  The default is '0' which does ansi processing.
  
  Note: the config param 'ansi_default' handles if the ansi handling is 
        configured default or not.  In which case the 'key' is reversed.
   
  Example:
    > say mid(this is a test,3,6)
    You say "s is a"
  
  See Also: delete(), ldelete(), remove()
  
& NCOMP()
  Function: ncomp(<number1>,<number2>)
  
  ncomp compares two numbers.  It returns 0 if they are the same, 1
  if number2 is less than number 1, and -1 otherwise.
  
  Example:
    > say ncomp(2,1)
    You say "1"
    > say ncomp(1,2)
    You say "-1"
    > say ncomp(2,2)
    You say "0"
   
  See Also: alphamin(), alphamax(), comp(), strdistance()
  
& COMP()
  Function: comp(<string1>, <string2>)
 
  Comp compares two strings.  It returns 0 if they are the same, 1 if
  string2 is less than/precedes alphabetically string1, and -1 
  otherwise.
  
  Example:
    > say comp(is,is)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: alphamin(), alphamax(), ncomp(), strdistance()
  
& CHARIN()
  Function: charin(<player>[,<type>])
  
  Charin returns the total number of characters of input that character has
  received.  If the type is '1', it will return the information in the form
  of PORT:CHARIN.  
  
  Example:
    > charin(me)
    You say "4328"
 
  This is generally only accessable by wizards.
  
& CHKREALITY()
  Function: chkreality(<victim>,<target>)
  
  Returns '1' if <victim> can see <target> in the reality.  This takes into
  account the optional reality lock (settable by @lock/user) as well as
  any realities that the player(s) belong to.  You must control both the
  target and the victim to get the result, else it will return #-1.
  
  Reality levels must be enabled for this function to be of use.
  
  See Also: hasrxlevel(), hastxlevel(), rxlevel(), txlevel()
  
& ENCODE64()
& DECODE64()
  Function: encode64(<string>)
            decode64(<string>)
  
  encode64() returns <string> encoded using base-64 format.
  
  decode64() converts a base-64 encoded <string> back to its original form.
  
  Any invalid characters fed to the string will cause the entire string to be
  ignored.
  
  Examples:
    > say encode64(test 1 2 3)
    You say "dGVzdCAxIDIgMw=="
    > say decode64(dGVzdCAxIDIgMw==)
    You say "test 1 2 3"
  
  See Also: encrypt(), decrypt(), pack(), digest()
  
& ENCRYPT()
  Function: encrypt(<string>,<seed>)
  
  Returns an encrypted string based on the given seed.  The longer the seed,
  the better the password.  Due to cryptology laws around the world, this
  function can only be enabled with a compile-time option.
  
  This function may not be available outside of the United States.
  
  Example:
    > say encrypt(this is a test,a)
    You say "VJKUaKUaCaVGUV"
  
  See Also: decrypt(), encode64(), decode64(), digest()
  
& DECRYPT()
  Function: decrypt(<string>,<seed>)
  
  Returns a decrypted string based on the given seed and encrypted string.
  You have to match the seed (case sensitive) to be able to decrypt the
  string properly.  Due to cryptology laws around the world, this function
  can only be enabled with a compile-time option.
  
  This function may not be available outside of the United States.
  
  Example:
    > say encrypt(VJKUaKUaCaVGUV,a)
    You say "this is a test"
  
  See Also: encrypt(), encode64(), decode64(), digest()
  
& PUSHREGS()
  Function: pushregs(<value(s)>)
  
  This function will preserve then restore setq() registers for the life
  of the command in question.  Keep in mind, if you attempt to restore
  the registers before saving them, you will overwrite all the registers
  with blanks (or nulls).  There are two options you can use:

  Option #1:
    Toggle of '1' saves ALL the registers, while a toggle of '0' restores 
    ALL the registers.
  
  Option #2:
    +<register> will save the specified register (letter/number only).
    -<register> will restore the specified register (letter/number only).
    Note: you may specify any number of registers and use +/- together.
  
  Examples: (Option #1)
    > say [setq(0,one)]-[r(0)]-[setq(0,two)]-[r(0)]-
    You say "-one--two-"
    > say [setq(0,one)]-[r(0)]-[pushregs(1)][setq(0,two)]-[pushregs(0)][r(0)]-
    You say "-one--one-"
  
  Examples: (Option #2)
    > say [setq(0,one)][setq(1,two)]-%q0%q1-[pushregs(+0)][setq(0,xxx)]
          [setq(1,abc)]-%q0%q1-[pushregs(-0)]--%q0%q1--
    You say "-onetwo--xxxabc--oneabc-
  
  Note:  You may use nameq() to get the letter/number of a label.
  
  See Also: setq(), setr(), nameq(), r(), substitutions
  
& LISTFLAGS()
  Function: listflags()
  
  This function will return all the flags that you have access to.
  
  Example:
    > say listflags()
    You say "ABODE(A) ARCHITECT(B) ... " 
  
  See Also: listcommands(), listfunctions()
  
& LISTCOMMANDS()
  Function: listcommands()
  
  This function will return all the commands that you have access to.
  
  Example:
    > say listcommands()
    You say "@@ @alias ... "
  
  See Also: listfunctions(), listtoggles()
  
& LISTFUNCTIONS()
  Function: listfunctions([keyval])
  
  This function will return all the functions that you have access to.
  Valid keyvalues are:
    0 - List all functions (built-in and user-defined)  This is the default.
    1 - List only the built-in functions.
    2 - List only the user-defined functions.
  
  Example:
    > say listfunctions()
    You say "@@ ABS ... "
   
  See Also: listcommands(), listtoggles()
  
& LISTNEWSGROUPS()
  Function: listnewsgroups([<player>])
  
  This function serves two purposes.  If no arguments are given, it will
  display all the news groups currently available.  If you specify a player
  that you control, it will list all the news groups that player has access
  to.  If you do not control the player, or if the player is not valid, it
  returns an error message.
  
  Examples:
    > say listnewsgroups()
    You say "admin info general"
    > say listnewsgroups(me)
    You say "info general"
  
  See Also: news, news cmdlist
  
& LISTTOGGLES()
  Function: listtoggles()
  
  This function will return all the toggles that you have access to.
  
  Example:
    > say listtoggles()
    You say "VANILLA_ERRORS(V) ... "
    
  See Also: listcommands(), listfunctions()
  
& LISTPROTECTION()
  Function: listprotection(<player> [,<key>,<delim>])
  
  This function will list all the 'protected names' (ergo @protect) that the
  player has.  If no key is specified (or a 0 specified as key) it lists all
  protected names.  The following keys exist:
  
    0 - list all protected names of the target player (default)
    1 - list only the protected names that are marked as aliases.
    2 - list only the protected names that are not marked as aliases.
  
  If the player is invalid, it returns an error, otherwise it returns an
  empty string if nothing is found for that criteria.
  
  The default deliminator is a colon (:).
  
  Example:
    > say listprotection(me)
    You say "Bob|Bobby"
  
  See Also: @protect, @name, @alias

& LIT()
  Function: lit(<string>)
  
  This function returns the string 'as-is' without formatting or evaluation.
  
  Examples:
    > say [space(3)]hi[space(3)]
    You say "   hi   "
    > say [lit([space(3)]hi[space(3)])]
    You say "[space(3)]hi[space(3)]"
  
& CHAROUT()
  Function: charout(<player>[,<type>])
  
  Charout returns the total number of characters of output that the character
  has sent.  If the type is '1', it will return the information in the form
  of PORT:CHAROUT.
  
  Examples:
    > say charout(me)
    You say "12959"
    > say charout(me,1)
    You say "10:12000 11:959"  
   
  This is generally only accessable to wizards.
  
& CMDS()
  Function: cmds(<player>[,<type> [,<port>]])
  
  Cmds returns the number of commands the player has typed during their current
  connected session.  If the player is not connected, it returns the commands
  typed since their last connected session.
  
  If the type is '1', then it gives an expanded cmd() listing if the player is
  connected by returning the information in the form PORT:CMD.
  
  You may specify the specified port of the player for an exact cmdlist based
  on port.
  
  If the type is '1' and the player is not connected, it returns the default
  behavior.
  
  Note: Only wizards may retreive command info on other players.
  
  Examples:
    > say cmds(me)
    You say "111"
    > say cmds(me,1)
    You say "10:99 11:12"
      
  See Also: totcmds()
  
& TRANSLATE()
  Function: translate(<string>,<type>)
  
  This function, when given a 'p' or '1', will translate all special 
  characters (like tabs, returns, ansi, etc) to the proper percent
  substitutions.  When given a 's' or '0', it will convert all the special
  characters to spaces.  Please keep in mind that as RhostMUSH strips ansi
  at the function level, that this will not work as you expect with ansi!
  
  Examples:
    > @wait 0=@va me=This%t%tis%ratest
    Set.
    > say v(va)
    You say "You say "This           is
    atest"
    > say translate(v(va),p)
    You say "This%t%tis%ratest"
    > say translate(v(va),s)
    You say "this  is atest"
  
  See Also: strip(), edit(), editansi(), s(), eval(), regedit()
  
& TOTCMDS()
  Function: totcmds(<player>)
  
  Totcmds returns the total number of commands issued by the player from the
  time of their creation.  
  
  Example:
    > totcmds(me)
    You say "12345" 
  
  See Also: cmds()
  
& SQUISH()
  Function: squish(string)
  
  This function takes out all leading and ending spaces and reduces all spaces
  in-between to only one space.
  
  Example:
   >say squish([space(10)]hi![space(10)]Bye![space(10)])
    You say "hi! Bye!"
  
  See Also: s()
  
& S()
  Function: s(string)
 
  This function performs pronoun substitution in a string, and then returns
  that string.  As usually, %n is the name, %s the subjective pronoun, %o the
  objective, %p the possessive, and %a the absolute possessive.  It is
  important to note that the pronoun is that of the triggering object.
 
  So, if the ve of an object were: "[s(This is %n)], and I were to 
  type @trigger <object>/ve, it would return "This is <myname>", but 
  if vf were @trigger me/ve, then triggering the vf makes the ve 
  return "This is <object>"
  
  Example:
    > @sex me=male
    Set.
    > s(this [add(1,1)] %s)
    You say "this 2 his" 
  
  See Also: SUBSTITUTIONS
  
& SAFEBUFF()
  Function: safebuff(<list> [,<delim>])
  
  This function will return the list, by cutting off from the end any partial
  string, based on the delimeter you specify <delim>.  If no delimeter is
  specified, it assumes a space.  A good place to have this is in search()
  functions that may reach or exceed the LBUF limit for output.
  
  Please note, ansi sequences will be stripped from this function before
  the buffer is cut back.  Thus, any ansi sequence given to this function
  will be removed.
  
  Example:
    > say search(eval=*)
    You say "#0 #1 ... #883 #884 #88" (in this case, '#885' would be cut off)
    > say safebuff(search(eval=*))
    You say "#0 #1 ... #883 #884" (the partial string '#885' was omitted)
  
  In the above examples, the '...' would be the huge ammount of output.
  
  See Also: lit(), s(), t()
  
& POS()
  Function: pos(<string1>,<string2>[,<type>])
   
  This function returns the position that string1 begins in string2,
  with the first position being 1.
  If string1 is not in string2, then it returns #-1.
  
  You may optionally specify a <type> of '1' to tell pos() to match ANY
  of the characters specified in <string1> and to return the first match. 
  
  Example: 
    > say pos(man,superman)
    You say "6"
    > say pos(uman,superman,1)
    You say "2"
    > say pos(nam,superman,1)
    You say "6"
  
  See Also: totpos(), numpos(), randpos()
  
& TOTPOS()
  Function: totpos(<match>,<string>[,<type>])
  
  This function returns all the positions of 'match' in the given 'string'.
  This works just like pos() but will give the character placement of
  all the matches instead of the pos()'s first match.
  
  If a match is not found in string, an empty value is returned (null).
  
  The following types are available:
    1 - Tells totpos() to match ANY of the characters specified in 
        <string> and to return all the matches. 
    2 - Tells totpos() to match ANY of the characters specified in
        <string> and return the characters matched, in order, that
        were found.
  
  Note:  Options 1 and 2 are good mixes to stage and prep replacement
         with the creplace() function.
   
  Example:
    > say totpos(t,this is a test)
    You say "1 11 14"
    > say totpos(ts,this is a test,1)
    You say "1 4 7 11 13 14"
    > say totpos(ts,this is a test,2)
    You say "tsstst"
    > say totpos(t,foobles)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: numpos(), pos(), randpos(), creplace()
  
& NUMPOS()
  Function: numpos(<match>,<string>[,<type>])
  
  This function returns the total number of matches of 'match' in the
  string 'string'.  This works like totpos() but returns the number
  of matches instead of the position of the matches.  If no matches
  are found, it returns a '0'.
  
  You may optionally specify a <type> of '1' to tell numpos() to match ANY
  of the characters specified in <string> and to return the total.
  
  Example:
    > say numpos(t,this is a test)
    You say "3"
    > say numpos(ts,this is a test,1)
    You say "6"
    > say totpos(t,foobles)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: totpos(), pos(), randpos()
  
& NUMMATCH()
  Function: nummatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
  
  This function returns the total number of matches <pattern> against each
  word of <string>.  If no words match, then 0 is returned.  The case is 
  not significant.
  
  The pattern may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' matches any one
  character, while '*' matches any number of characters, including none.
  So 'b??f' would match 'biff', 'boff', 'beef', but not 'borchf'.  'b*f'
  would match any of them though.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than the standard space.
  
  Examples:
  > say nummatch(This is a test, test)
  You say '1'
  > say nummatch(This test is a test of nummatch.  A test is fun, test)
  You say '3'
  > say nummatch(This test is silly, fred)
  You say '0'

& CHOMP()
  Function: chomp(<string> [,<option>])
  
  The chomp() function is used to strip carrage returns from the start,
  end, or both sides of a string.
  
  The following options are available:
    l - strip carrage returns on left side of string.
    r - strip carrage returns on right side of string.
    b - strip carrage returns on both sides of string (default).
   
  Examples:
  > say chomp(%rthis is a test%r)
  You say "this is a test"
  > say chomp(%rthis is a test%r,l)
  You say "this is a test
  "
  > say chomp(%rthis is a test%r,r)
  You say "
  this is a test"

& CHR()
  Function: chr(<number>)
  
  This function returns the character representation of the ASCII value
  entered.  Naturally, only printable characters are allowed and will
  notify you if a number is out of range.
  
  Examples:
  > say chr(97)
  You say "a"
  
  Note:  Using chr() on 37, 92, and any character between 160 and 255
         will padd out any padding you have by an additional 5 characters
         per use.  While the padding functions take this into account
         automatically, it's something to keep in mind.
    
  See Also: ASC()
  
& ASC()
  Function: asc(<character>)
  
  This function returns the ASCII numerical value of the given character.
  
  Examples:
  > say asc(a)
  You say "97"
  
  See Also: CHR()
  
& sees()
  Function: sees(<object>, <target> [,<type>])
  
  This function returns true (1) if the object is able to see target at
  target's location.  Otherwise, it will return false (0).  You need to
  control the object to be able to successfully return the result else
  '0' will always be returned.  This will work similiar if you actually
  looked at the room.  Naturally, as you wouldn't see yourself, it'll
  return '0' for that condition.
  
  You may specify <type> as '1' if you wish to check for exits.  Normally
  exits will be ignored.
  
  Examples:
    > look
    A room
    You see a room before you.
    Contents:
    testobj
    > say sees(me,me)
    You say "0"
    > say sees(me,testobj)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: look, visible()
  
& delextract()
  Function: delextract(<string>, <first>, <length>[, <delim>])
  
  Delextract returns a string of words that were not in the list that you
  specified.  This in effect works exactly opposite of extract.  Delim
  may be used to specify a delimiter other than space if desired.
  
  Examples:
    > say delextract(This is a really neat example, 4, 2)
    You say "This is a example"
    > say extract(Another@funky@test@for@extract, 3, 3, @)
    You say "Another@funky"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), index(), insert(), ldelete(), replace(),
            randextract()
  
& elist()
  Function: elist(<str>[,<phrase>[,<delim>[,<sep>[,<punctuation>[,<munge>]]]]])
  
  The elist function is used to return a list of words into an english
  recognizable format.  You may specify an output delimiter to use if
  you wish but it makes the format rather unique.  You may specify a seperate
  punctuation instead of the default comma (,).  The punctuation may be
  more than one character.  You may specify the seperator if not a space as 
  well.
  
  You can also supply a munging function to apply for each argument passed to
  elist.  So that if you passed in dbref#'s, you can munge to the name()
  function.  All arguments are passed as %0.  The order number of how they're
  passed is %1.
  
  Examples:
    > say elist(test)
    You say "test"
    > say elist(this test)
    You say "this and test"
    > say elist(this test again)
    You say "this, test, and again"
    > say elist(this test again,,,,;)
    You say "this; test; and again"
    > say elist(this test again,at least I think)
    You say "this, test, at least I think again"
    > say elist(one/two/three,what a life,/)
    You say "one, two, what a life three"
    > say elist(one/two/three,what a life,/,/)
    You say "one,/two,/what a life/three"
  
  See Also: iter(), citer(), nsiter(), list()
  
& CREPLACE()
  Function: creplace(<string>, <position>, <string2>[, <type>][,<range>])
            creplace(<string>, <position list>, <character>)
  
  The creplace function will replace characters starting at position
  <position> and based on the type, will continue to overwrite till
  end of one of the strings.  You can replace one or more characters.
  
  If you specify the range, it will give the number of characters to enact
  upon.  Default is length of string2.
  
  The second option only allows three arguments, and will replace the 
  character positions specfied in the space delimited <position list>
  with the character(s) specified with <character>.  If you specify more
  than one character, it will continue to wrap around the list until
  the end of the string is met.
  
  Note:  The second option can use output from totpos() to stage and prep
         the values you want to replace depending on the situation.
  
  Valid types are: 
        o - overwrite : starting at position it'll continue to overwrite
            until the end of the <string2>. (this is the default behavior)
        c - overwrite and cut: starting at position it'll continue to
            overwrite up to the maximum length of the original string.
        i - insert : starting at position it'll insert all of string2
            into the string.
  
  Examples:
    > say creplace(this is a test,4,whee)
    You say "thiwhee a test"
    > say creplace(this is a test,4,wheewheewhoowha!)
    You say "thiwheewheewhoowha!"
    > say creplace(this is a test,4,wheewheewhoowha!,c)
    You say "thiwheewheewho" 
    > say creplace(this is a test,4,wheewheewhoowha!,i)
    You say "thiwheewheewhoowha!s is a test"
  
  Option 2 Example:
    > say creplace(this is a test,1 3 4,X)
    You say "XhXX is a test"
    > say creplace(this is a test,1 3 4,XYZ)
    You say "XhYZ is a test"
  
  See Also: replace(), lreplace(), totpos()
  
& strmath()
  Function: strmath(<str>,<num>,<math>[,<dlm>,<sep>,<st>,<amt>,<idlm>,<isep>)
  
  The strmath function is used to apply math to the entire string.  Numbers
  in the string are modified based on the math chosen applied to the number.
  You may specify optional input and output seperators.  You may also specify
  the word to start (<st>) the math on and how many words (<amt>) after the 
  start you wish to use. If no math is specified, '+' is used as a default.
  The <idlm> and <isep> are inner delimiter and seperator to use for the 
  normal delimited string.  This is so you can separate values such as:
                    To hit:5|To Damage:10|Base AC:15
  
  Note:  It handles floating point notation, so values with decimals are seen.
   
    Key:  str  -- input string    num  -- value to apply  math -- math to use
          dlm  -- delimiter       sep  -- seperator       st   -- start value
          amt  -- word count      idlm -- inner delim     isep -- inner sep
  
  Valid math arguments are:
        + - apply addition to all numbers in the string.
        - - apply subtraction to all numbers in the string.
        / - apply division to all numbers in the string.
        * - apply multiplication to all numbers in the string.
       %% - return remainder of division. (you need to use two %%'s)
  
  Examples:
    > say strmath(1 fish 2 fish green fish blue fish,10,+)   (default)
    You say "11 fish 12 fish green fish blue fish"
    > say strmath(1 fish 2 fish green fish blue fish,10,*)
    You say "10 fish 20 fish green fish blue fish"
    > say strmath(1 fish 2 fish 3 shoe 4 shoe,10,+,,,3,2)
    You say "1 fish 12 fish 13 shoe 4 shoe"
    > say strmath(To hit:5|To Damage:10|Base AC:15,150,+,|,|,1,0,:,:)
    You say "To hit:155|To Damage:10|Base AC:15"

& LMATH()
  See strfunc()

& STRFUNC()
  Function: strfunc(<function>, <list of arguments>[,<delim>])
  
  The strfunc (string function) function is used to transform a 
  string of arguments into seperate identified arguments and feed 
  them into the specified function.  If you do not have access to the 
  function or if you give the target function an invalid number of 
  arguments, an error message will be displayed.
  
  This in effect will turn any function in the game into a string
  oriented function.  Thus the name, 'strfunc'.
  
  Examples:
    > say add(1,2,3,4)
    You say "10"
    > say strfunc(add,1 2 3 4)
    You say "10"
    > say strfunc(add,1@2@3@4,@)
    You say "10"
    > say hastype(me,player)
    You say "1"
    > say strfunc(hastype,me player)
    You say "1"
    > say switch(add(1,1),2,match,1,nope,0,nope,nope)
    You say "match"
    > say strfunc(switch,add(1,1) 2 match 1 nope 0 nope nope)
    You say "match"
  
  See Also: strmath(), ladd(), lsub(), ldiv(), lmul()
  
& wildmatch()
  Function: wildmatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
 
  This function matches <pattern> against each word of <string>, returning
  the number of the first word that matches.  If no words match then 0 is
  returned.  The case of the characters being matched is not significant.
 
  The words in the string  may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' 
  matches any one character, while '*' matches any number of characters, 
  including none.  So 's?x' would match 'sex' or 'six', but not to 'socx', 
  but 's*x' would match any of them.  <delim> may be used specified to 
  specify a delimiter other than a space.
  Examples:
    > say wildmatch(This is a test, test)
    You say "4"
    > say wildmatch(This is a test, is)
    You say "2"
    > say wildmatch(This *is* a test, whiss)
    You say "2"
    > say wildmatch(This is a test *, *not*)
    You say "5"
    > say wildmatch(This is a test, is a)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: member(), strmatch(), subnetmatch(), numwildmatch(), 
            totwildmatch(), match()
  
& numwildmatch()
  Function: numwildmatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>]) 
  
  This function returns the total number of matches <pattern> against each
  word of <string>.  If no words match, then 0 is returned.  The case is 
  not significant.  This works like wildmatch() except returns # of matches. 
  
  The string may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' matches any one
  character, while '*' matches any number of characters, including none.
  So 'b??f' would match 'biff', 'boff', 'beef', but not 'borchf'.  'b*f'
  would match any of them though.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than the standard space.
  
  Examples:
  > say numwildmatch(This is a test, test)
  You say '1'
  > say numwildmatch(This test is a test of nummatch.  A test is fun, test)
  You say '3'
  > say numwildmatch(This test *e* is silly *ed, fred)
  You say '2'
  
  See Also: nummatch(), nummember(), wildmatch(), totwildmatch()
  
& totwildmatch()
  Function: totwildmatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
  
  This function returns all matches of <pattern> against each word of
  <string>.  This works just like wildmatch(), except it returns every
  match and location of each match.  String also understands wildcarding
  such as '?' or '*'.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than the standard space.
  
  Examples:
  > say totwildmatch(This is a test, test)
  You say "4"
  > say totwildmatch(This test is a test of totmatch. A test is fun, test)
  You say "2 5 9"
  > say totwildmatch(This test *e* is silly *ed, fred)
  You say "3 6"
  
  See Also: totmatch(), totmember(), wildmatch(), numwildmatch()
  
  
& TOTMATCH()
  Function: totmatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
  
  This function returns all matches of <pattern> against each word of
  <string>.  This works just like match(), except it returns every
  match and location of each match.  This also understands wildcarding
  such as '?' or '*'.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than the standard space.
  
  Examples:
  > say totmatch(This is a test, test)
  You say "4"
  > say totmatch(This test is a test of totmatch. A test is fun, test)
  You say "2 5 9"
  > say totmatch(This test is silly, fred)
  You say "0"
  
  See Also: match(), nummatch(), member(), nummember(), totmember()
  
& GRABALL()
  Function: graball(<string>, <pattern>[, <delimeter>[, <seperator>]])
   
  This function matches <pattern> against each word of <string>, returning
  the all the words it matches.  If no words are found to match the pattern,
  then an empty string is returned.  <pattern> may consist of wildcards.
  Wildcards being the use of '*' for any number of characters or '?' for
  a single character.  An optional delimiter may be used as well as an
  optional output seperator. 
  
  Examples:
    > graball(This is a test,*es*)
    You say "test"
    > graball(This is a test,*is*)
    You say "This is"
    > graball(players are cool.,*y*)
    You say "players"
    > graball(this is@a test,*es*,@)
    You say "a test"
    > graball(this is@a test@2 test,*es*,|)
    You say "a test|2 test"
 
  See Also: match(), member(), totmatch(), totmember(), grep(), grab()
  
& GRAB()
  Function: grab(<string>, <pattern>[, <delimeter>])
   
  This function matches <pattern> against each word of <string>, returning
  the first word it matches.  If no words are found to match the pattern,
  then an empty string is returned.  <pattern> may consist of wildcards.
  Wildcards being the use of '*' for any number of characters or '?' for
  a single character.  An optional delimiter may be used.
  
  Examples:
    > grab(This is a test,*es*)
    You say "test"
    > grab(players are cool.,*y*)
    You say "players"
    > grab(this is@a test,*es*,@)
    You say "a test"
   
  See Also: match(), member(), totmatch(), totmember(), grep(), graball()
  
& REGRAB()
  Function: regrab(<list>, <regexp>[, <delimiter>])
  
  This function returns the first word in list which matches the pattern.
  For grab(), the pattern is specified as in match(); i.e., it
  can contain wildcards. For regrab(), the pattern is a regular expression.
  
  Basically, this is a much more efficient way to do:
  1: extract(list, match(list, pattern, delimiter), 1) 
  2: extract(list, regmatch(list, regexp, delimiter), 1)
  
  Examples:
    > say regrab(this that those, (.)hat)
    You say "that"
    > say regrab(this tHat those phat, (.)hat)
    You say "phat"
  
  See Also: regrabi(), regraball(), regraballi(), grab(), graball()
    
& REGRABI()
  Function: regrabi(<list>, <regexp>[, <delimiter>])
  
  This function returns the first word in list which matches the pattern.
  For grab(), the pattern is specified as in match(); i.e., it
  can contain wildcards. For regrab(), the pattern is a regular expression.
  regrabi() is case-insensitive.
  
  Basically, this is a much more efficient way to do:
  1: extract(list, match(list, pattern, delimiter), 1)
  2: extract(list, regmatch(list, regexp, delimiter), 1)
  
  Examples:
    > say regrabi(this that those, (.)hat)
    You say "that"
    > say regrab(this tHat those phat, (.)hat)
    You say "tHat"
  
  See Also: regrab(), regraball(), regraballi(), grab(), graball()
    
& REGRABALL()
  Function: regraball(<string>,<regexp>[,<delim>][,<output seperator>])
  
  These functions work identically to the grab() and regrab()/regrabi()
  functions, save that they return all matches, not just the first: They
  return all words in the list <string> which match <pattern>.
  If none match, an empty string is returned.
  
  Examples:
  > say graball(This is a test of a test,test)
  You say "test test"
  > say graball(This is testing a test,tes*)
  You say "testing test"
  > say regraball(This is testing a test,s$)
  You say "This is"
  
  See also: match(), matchall(), grab(), regmatch(), regraballi(), regrab()
  
& REGRABALLI()
  Function: regraballi(<string>,<regexp>[,<delim>][,<output seperator>])
  
  These functions work identically to the grab() and regrab()/regrabi()
  functions, save that they return all matches, not just the first: They
  return all words in the list <string> which match <pattern>.
  If none match, an empty string is returned.  This function is case-
  insensitive.
  
  Examples:
  > say graball(This is a test of a test,test)
  You say "test test"
  > say graball(This is testing a test,tes*)
  You say "testing test"
  > say regraballi(This is testing a test,s$)
  You say "This is"
  
  See also: match(), matchall(), grab(), regmatch()

& GREP()
  Function: grep(<object>, <attribute(s)>, <pattern> [,<key>])
   
  This returns a list of any matching attribute that matches the
  <attribute(s)> that contain <pattern>.  The <attribute> may be wildcarded
  with a '*' or a '?' for multiple character matches and single character
  matches respectively.  In addition, the pattern may also be wildcarded.
   
  If <key> is specified as '1', it will no longer assume a wildcard match
  unless explicitly given.
   
  Examples:
    > @va me=This is a test
    > @vb me=This is another test.
    > @vc me=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say grep(me,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say grep(me,v*,is,1)
    You say "VA VB"
    > say grep(me,v*,*is*)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say grep(me,*,*)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say grep(me,*,Bark?)
    You say ""
 
  See Also: pgrep(), regrep(), regrepi(), grab(), match(), lattr(), @grep
  
& PGREP()
  Function: pgrep(<object>, <attr(s)>, <pattern> [,<type> [,<delim> [,<key>]]])
  
  This function behaves just like the normal grep() function except it 
  transverses all parents for the grep that returns a list of any matching 
  attribute that matches the <attr(s)> that contain <pattern>.  The <attr> 
  may be wildcarded with a '*' or a '?' for multiple character matches and 
  single character matches respectively.  In addition, the pattern may also 
  be wildcarded.  You may specify an optional output delimiter.  
  The valid types are:
      0 - show just matched attributes (default)
      1 - show the dbref# then matching attributes after it in sets
      2 - show the attributes in a dbref#/attribute pattern.
  
  By default, grep assumes the pattern is always wildcarded.  You may specify
  the key of '1' to disable assumped wildcarding and enforce literal wildcard
  placement.
    
  Examples:
    > @va me=This is a test
    > @vb me=This is another test.
    > @vc me=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say pgrep(me,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say pgrep(me,v*,is,,,1)
    You say "VA VB"
    > say pgrep(me,v*,*is*)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say pgrep(me,*,*)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say pgrep(me,*,Bark?)
    You say ""
 
  See Also: grep(), regrep(), regrepi(), grab(), match(), lattr(), @grep
 
& REGREP()
  Function: regrep(<object>,<attrs>,<regexp> [,<key>])
  
  This function returns a list of attributes on <object> containing
  <pattern> (or matching <regexp>).  <attrs> is a wildcard pattern for
  attribute names to search; if you want to search all attributes, use "*".
  
  Parsing _does_ occur before this function is invoked. Therefore,
  "special" characters will need to be escaped out. 
  
  If <key> is specified as '1', attribute wildcards are done with
  regular expression matching.  The default is globbing (* and ?). 
  
  This function is case-sensitive. 
  
  Examples:
    > @va me=This is a test
    > @vb me=This is another test.
    > @vc me=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say regrep(me,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB"
    > say regrep(me,v*,.is.)
    You say "VA VB VC"
  
  See Also: regrepi(), grep(), pgrep()
  
& REGREPI()
  regrepi(<object>,<attrs>,<regexp> [,<key>])

  This function returns a list of attributes on <object> containing
  <pattern> (or matching <regexp>).  <attrs> is a wildcard pattern for
  attribute names to search; if you want to search all attributes, use "*".
  
  Parsing _does_ occur before this function is invoked. Therefore,
  "special" characters will need to be escaped out. 
  
  If <key> is specified as '1', attribute wildcards are done with
  regular expression matching.  The default is globbing (* and ?).
  
  This function is case-insensitive.
  
  Examples:
    > @va me=This is a test
    > @vb me=This is another test.
    > @vc me=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say regrepi(me,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB"
    > say regrepi(me,v*,.is.)
    You say "VA VB VC"

& REGEDITLIT()
& REGEDIT()
  Function: regedit(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[, ... , <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
            regeditlit(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[, ... , <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
  
  This function is a version of edit() that uses regular expressions.
  The part of <str> that matches the <regexp> is replaced by the
  evaluated <repl> (replacement), with $<number> in <replacement> expanded to
  the corresponding matching sub-expression of <regexp>, with $0 the entire
  matched section. regediti() only replaces the first match and is
  case sensitive.  The <replacement> argument is evaluated once for 
  each match, allowing for more complex transformations than is possible 
  with straight replacement.
  
  The regeditlit() function works same as regedit() but does not evaluate 
  the replaced values.
  
  Example:
  > say regedit(this test is the best string, (.)est, $1rash)
  You say "this trash is the best string"
  > say regedit(this test is the best string, (.)est, [capstr($1)]rash)
  You say "this Trash is the best string"
  
  See also: edit(), editansi(), regmatch(), regediti(), regeditall(), 
            regeditalli()

& REGEDITALLLIT()
& REGEDITALL()
  Function: regeditall(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[,..., <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
            regeditalllit(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[,..., <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
  
  This function is a version of edit() that uses regular expressions.
  The part of <str> that matches the <regexp> is replaced by the
  evaluated <repl> (replacement), with $<number> in <replacement> expanded to 
  the corresponding matching sub-expression of <regexp>, with $0 the entire
  matched section.  regeditall() replaces all matches.  The <replacement> 
  argument is evaluated once for each match, allowing for more complex 
  transformations than is possible with straight replacement.  
  
  The regeditalllit() function works same as regeditall() but does not evaluate
  the replaced values.
  
  Example:
  > say regeditall(this test is the best string, (.)est, $1rash)
  You say "this trash is the brash string"
  > say regeditall(this test is the best string, (.)est, [capstr($1)]rash)
  You say "this Trash is the Brash string"

& REGEDITILIT()
& REGEDITI()
  Function: regediti(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[, ... , <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
  Function: regeditilit(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[, ... , <regexpN>, <replaceN>])
   
  This function is a version of edit() that uses regular expressions.
  The part of <str> that matches the <regexp> is replaced by the
  evaluated <repl> (replacement), with $<number> in <replacement> expanded to 
  the corresponding matching sub-expression of <regexp>, with $0 the entire
  matched section. regediti() only replaces the first match and is case
  insensitive.  The <replacement> argument is evaluated once for
  each match, allowing for more complex transformations than is
  possible with straight replacement.
  
  The regeditilit() function works same as regediti() but does not evaluate 
  the replaced values.
  
  Example:
  > say regediti(this teSt is the best string, (.)est, $1rash)
  You say "this trash is the best string"
  > say regediti(this teSt is the best string, (.)est, [capstr($1)]rash)
  You say "this Trash is the best string"

& REGEDITALLILIT()
& REGEDITALLI()
  Function: regeditalli(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[,...,<regexpN>,<replaceN>])
            regeditallilit(<str>, <regexp>, <repl>[,...,<regexpN>,<replaceN>])
  
  This function is a version of edit() that uses regular expressions.
  The part of <str> that matches the <regexp> is replaced by the
  evaluated <repl> (replacement), with $<number> in <replacement> expanded to 
  the corresponding matching sub-expression of <regexp>, with $0 the entire
  matched section.  regeditalli() replaces all matches and is case 
  insensitive. The <replacement> argument is evaluated once for
  each match, allowing for more complex transformations than is
  possible with straight replacement.
  
  The regeditallilit() function works same as regeditalli() but does not 
  evaluate the replaced values.
   
  Example:
  > say regeditalli(this teSt is the best string, (.)est, $1rash)
  You say "this trash is the brash string"
  > say regeditalli(this test is the best string, (.)est, [capstr($1)]rash)
  You say "this Trash is the Brash string"

& REGNUMMATCHI()
& REGNUMMATCH()
  Function: regnummatch(<string>, <regexp>, [,<delimiter>])
            regnummatchi(<string>, <regexp>, [,<delimiter>])
  
  This function returns the total matches of any word in the string
  that matches the specified regular expression.  This works exactly
  like nummatch() except it uses regular expressions.
  
  Example:
  > say regnummatch(one two three four five fourteen,.*ou.*)
  You say "2"
  
  See Also: nummatch(), regmatch(), regmatchall(), regmatchalli()

& REGLMATCHALLI()
& REGLMATCHALL()
& REGLMATCHI()
& REGLMATCH()
  Function: reglmatchalli(<string>, <regexp> [,<delimiter>])
            reglmatchall(<string>, <regexp> [,<delimiter>])
            reglmatchi(<string>, <regexp> [,<delimiter>])
            reglmatch(<string>, <regexp> [,<delimiter>])
  
  This function returns the positional matches of every word in the
  string that matches the specified regular expression.  This is
  exactly like the totmatch() function except uses regular 
  expression matching.  This function is case sensitive.
  
  The non 'all' functions will only return the position of the first
  match, or in other words functions like match() would.
   
  The reglmatchi() and reglmatchalli() functions ignores case.
  
  Example:
    > say reglmatchall(one two three four five fourteen,.*ou.*)
    You say "4 6"
    > say reglmatch(one two three four five fourteen,.*ou.*)
    You say "4"
  
  See Also: totmatch(), regmatch(), regnummatch(), nummatch()
  
  'help regexp syntax' for an explanation of regular expressions.

& REGMATCH()
  Function: regmatch(<string>,<regexp>[,<register list>])
  
  This function matches the regular expression <regexp> against the
  entirety of <string>, returning 1 if it matches and 0 if it does not.
  This function is case sensitive.  It behaves like strmatch().
  
  If <register list> is specified, there is a side-effect: any
  parenthesized substrings within the regular expression will be set
  into the specified local registers, in the order they were specified
  in the list. <register list> can be a list of one through nine numbers.
  If the specified register is -1, the substring is not copied into a
  register. Under regmatchi, case of the substring may be modified.
  You may also use a-z as registers if currently enabled on your RhostMUSH.
  You may have to escape mush-special characters (like (, ), {, }, etc)
  Any invalid registers specified will be skipped over and ignored.
  
  Examples:
    > say regmatch(cookies=30,\(.+\)=\(\[0-9\]*\))
    You say "1"
    > say regmatch(cookies=30,\(.+\)=\(\[0-9\]*\),0 3 5) |%q0/%q3/%q5|
    You say "1 |cookies=30/cookies/30|
  
  See Also: 'help regexp syntax' for an explanation of regular expressions.
  
& REGMATCHI()
  Function: regmatchi(<string>,<regexp>[,<register list>])
  
  This function matches the regular expression <regexp> against the
  entirety of <string>, returning 1 if it matches and 0 if it does not.
  This function is case insensitive.
  
  If <register list> is specified, there is a side-effect: any
  parenthesized substrings within the regular expression will be set
  into the specified local registers, in the order they were specified
  in the list. <register list> can be a list of one through nine numbers.
  If the specified register is -1, the substring is not copied into a
  register. Under regmatchi, case of the substring may be modified.
  You may also use a-z as registers if currently enabled on your RhostMUSH.
  You may have to escape mush-special characters (like (, ), {, }, etc)
  Any invalid registers specified will be skipped over and ignored.
  
  Examples:
    > say regmatchi(cookies=30,\(.+\)=\(\[0-9\]*\))
    You say "1"
    > say regmatchi(cookies=30,\(.+\)=\(\[0-9\]*\),0 3 5) |%q0/%q3/%q5|
    You say "1 |cookies=30/cookies/30|
  
  See Also: 'help regexp syntax' for an explanation of regular expressions.
  
& DIE()
& DICE()
  Function: dice(<val1>,<val2>[[[[[,<type>],<botval>],<sep>],<fail>],<crit>])
   
  This function rolls the dice.  It works as if you were rolling dice and 
  returns the result.  <val1> is the number of dice and <val2> is the 
  sides of the dice.  For example dice(2,4) would specify you rolling 2 
  4-sided dice.   The following 'type' values exist.
     0 - default.  Just display the total of both dice.
     1 - Display all the rolls of the dice.
     2 - Display the totals, then display all the roles of the dice.
     3 - Display the totals, then all normal rolls of dice, then display 
         failures/criticals after with the default '|' seperator.
     4 - Display all the normal rolls of the dice, then display the
         failures, then the criticals seperated by the default '|' character.
     5 - Display just the totals, then failures/criticals after with
         the default '|' seperator.

  <botval> specifies low ceiling masks for the dice.  You may specify an 
  optional output seperator for the numbers.  If the seperator you specify
  is the '|' character, the seperator used for failure/criticals becomes ':'.
  
  You may specify offset values to the 'fail'ure or for 'crit'ical success.
  The offset increases the range of failure or success.
   
  Examples:
    > say dice(2,4)        [give me the total of rolling 2 4-sided dice]
      You say "3"
    > say dice(2,4,1)      [give me the total and individual dice rolls]
      You say "3 1 2"
    > say dice(2,4,2)      [give me just the individual dice rolls]
      You say "1 2"
    > say dice(2,4,2,3)    [give me just the dice rolls with MIN value of 3]
      You say "3 3"
    > say dice(2,4,2,,@)   [give me just the dice rolls with a seperator '@']
      You say "1@2"
   
  See Also: rand()
  
& SHIFT()
  Function: shift(<value>)
            shift()
  
  This function controls the values returned with %0-%9 (or v(0)-v(9)) with
  regards to u() attributes, functions or @functions.  Each increment to
  shift will shift the values 10.  So shift(1) will make %5 actually be
  the 15's argument, not the 5th.  You can shift up to the max arguments
  currently allowed by the mush.  The default is 30 total arguments, thus
  you can shift to the value '3'.
  
  If you do not specify an argument, it shows you what the current shift 
  value is set to.  This value resets itself for each pass through the
  queue (or by user-intervention).

  See Also: v()

& CHKTRACE()
  Function: chktrace()
  
  This function returns '1' (true) or '0' (false) if the parser is currently
  in trace (debug) mode.  This is handy for dynamically enabling or disabling
  trace on the fly.
  
  See Also: trace(), TRACE

& TRACE()
  Function: trace(<value>)
  
  This function controls the TRACE flag on the object executing the function.
  If the value is 0, the TRACE flag is removed. If the value is non-0 then
  the TRACE flag is set.
  
  This function can be used to selectively turn on trace output for a piece
  of MUSH code. This can help to avoid the often spammy output of trace.
   
  Example: (line 2 wrapped)
    > &broken object=[add(3,mul)(3,7))]
    > &test object=$testme *:@emit I am [trace(1)][u(me/broken)][trace(0)][swi
      tch(%0,0,zero,non-zero)].
    > testme 0
   
  In this example you'll see trace output only for the u() of the broken 
  attribute. You will not see trace output for the @emit or the switch().
  However, if the TRACE flag was set on the object prior to execution, then
  you would see trace output for everything up to the trace(0) call.
  
  See Also: TRACE, VERBOSE, PUPPET, chktrace()
  
& MATCH()
  Function: match(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
 
  This function matches <pattern> against each word of <string>, returning
  the number of the first word that matches.  If no words match then 0 is
  returned.  The case of the characters being matched is not significant.
 
  The pattern may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' matches any one
  character, while '*' matches any number of characters, including none.
  So 's?x' would match 'sex' or 'six', but not to 'socx', but 's*x' would
  match any of them.
  
  <delim> may be used specified to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  Examples:
    > say match(This is a test, test)
    You say "4"
    > say match(This is a test, is)
    You say "2"
    > say match(This is a test, *is*)
    You say "1"
    > say match(This is a test, *not*)
    You say "0"
    > say match(This is a test, is a)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: LISTS, member(), strmatch(), subnetmatch(), nummatch(), totmatch()
  
& STRMATCH()
  Function: strmatch(<string>,<pattern>)
 
  This function matches <pattern> against the entire <string>, returning 1
  if it matches and 0 if it does not.  The case of the characters being
  matched is not significant.
 
  The pattern may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' matches any one
  character, while '*' matches any number of characters, including none.
  So 's?x' would match 'sex' or 'six', but not to 'socx', but 's*x' would
  match any of them.
 
  Examples:
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*Test)
    You say "1"
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*This)
    You say "0"
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*is*is*)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: match(), member(), nummatch(), nummember(), totmatch(), totmember()

& SUBNETMATCH()
  Function: subnetmatch(<ip>,<netstart>,<netmask>)
            subnetmatch(<ip>,<netstart>/<CIDR>)
  
  This function allows you to check wether an IP falls into a certain subnet
  or not. The function allows you to use either a format specifying the
  subnet address and netmask, or the common CIDR format.
  
  It returns 1 if the IP address is part of the subnet, 0 if it is not.
  
  Examples:
    subnetmatch(123.123.123.123, 123.0.0.0, 255.0.0.0) -> 1
    subnetmatch(123.123.123.123, 123.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0) -> 0
    subnetmatch(123.123.123.123, 123.0.0.0/8) -> 1
    subnetmatch(123.123.123.123, 123.0.0.0/16) -> 0
  
& EXTRACT()
  Function: extract(<string>, <first>, <length>[, <delim>])
 
  Extract returns a string of length words, starting with the first 
  word. Unlike letters, the first word in a string is number 1, 
  instead of 0.
 
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  Examples:
    > say extract(This is a really neat example, 4, 2)
    You say "really neat"
    > say extract(Another@funky@test@for@extract, 3, 3, @)
    You say "test@for@extract" 
  
  See Also: extractword(), index(), insert(), ldelete(), replace(), 
            randextract()
  
& EXTRACTWORD()
  Function: extractword(<string>, <first>, <length>[, <delim>], <sep>] ,<del>])
  
  Extractword returns a string of length words, starting with the first
  word.  This works effectively like extract(), however, the deliminiter 
  <delim> and seperator <sep> can be multi-character.  In addition, the
  seperator may also contain ansi or special characters.
  
  If you specify the <del> toggle to '1' it assumes delextract() compatibility
  where the words choosen are all the words EXCEPT the range specified.
   
  Unlike extract(), extractword() is also ansi-aware.
  
  The default <delim> is a space.  The default <sep> is whatever <delim>
  is defined as.
  
  Examples:
    > say extractword(This is a really neat example, 4, 2)
    You say "really neat"
    > say extractword(a@@@multi@@@char@@@delimiter, 2, 2, @@@)
    You say "multi@@@char"
    > say extractword(a@@@multi@@@char@@@delimiter, 2, 2, @@@,%b)
    You say "multi char"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), index(), insert(), ldelete(), replace(),
            randextract() 
  
& INDEX()
  Function: index(<list>,<character>,<first>,<length>)
  
  This function is similar to EXTRACT(), except that an item in the
  list may be more than one word; instead of a space being used to
  separate items in the list, <character> is used. The function returns 
  <length> items starting from that in the <first> position. Trailing
  spaces are trimmed. The comma cannot be used as the <character> separator. 
 
  Example:
    > say [index(Cup of Tea | Mug of Beer | Glass of Wine, |, 2, 1)]
    You say, "Mug of Beer"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), aindex(), iindex(), rindex()
  
& AIINDEX()
  Function: aiindex(<list>, <string>, <position>, <delimiter>)
  
  This function is similar to index(), except that it inserts the <string>
  at the <position> in the given <list>.  You must specify a delimiter.
  For a space, use a '%b' as a delimiter.  This works exactly like iindex()
  except it allows you to 'add insert' to an empty list.
  
  Example:
    > say aiindex(this is a test,another cat and,3,%b)
    You say "this is another cat and a test"
    > say aiindex(,another test,1,|)
    You say "another test"
    > say aiindex(another test,a test,1,|)
    You say "a test|another test"
  
  See Also: index(), rindex(), aindex()
  
& IINDEX()
  Function: iindex(<list>, <string>, <position>, <delimiter>)
  
  This function is similar to index(), except that it inserts the <string>
  at the <position> in the given <list>.  You must specify a delimiter.
  For a space, use a '%b' as a delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say iindex(this is a test,another cat and,3,%b)
    You say "this is another cat and a test"
  
  See Also: index(), rindex(), aindex()
  
& AINDEX()
  Function: aindex(<list>, <string>, <position>, <delimiter>)
  
  This function is similar to index(), except that it appends the <string>
  after the <position> in the given <list>.  You must specify a delimiter.
  For a space, use a '%b' as a delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say aindex(this is a test,was and,1,%b)
    You say "this was and is a test"
  
  See Also: index(), rindex, iindex()
  
& RINDEX()
  Function: rindex(<list>, <string>, <position>, <delimiter>)
  
  This function is similar to index(), except that it replaces the <string>
  starting at <position> in the given <list>.  You must specify a delimiter.
  If the string you are replacing is longer than the list, it is 
  automatically appended to the end.
  
  Example:
    > say rindex(this is a test,was another,2,%b)
    You say "this was another test"
    > say rindex(this is weird,rather weird you know,3,%b)
    You say "this is rather weird you know"
  
  See Also: index(), aindex, iindex()
  
& ART()
  Function: art(<string> [,<key>])
  This returns the string prefixed with an 'a' or an 'an' article depending
  if the first letter in the string is a consonant or a vowel.
  
  If you specify a <key> of '1', then only the article will be displayed. 
  
  Examples:
    > say art(apple)
    You say "an apple"
    > say art(bear)
    You say "a bear"
    > say art(bear,1)
    You say "a"
 
  See Also: poss(), subj(), obj()
  
& ATTRCNT()
  Function: attrcnt(<object> [,<key>])
  This returns the total number of attributes that the target object has.
  This gets around some limitations of words(lattr(<object>)) due to the
  parser limitation.  This attribute has the sideeffect of repairing
  attribute corruption on the target.
  
  The following keys exist:
      0 - (default) - list attributes and delete corrupted attributes.
      1 - list attributes and attempt to repair corrupted attributes.
      2 - list attributes but do not touch corrupted attributes.
      3 - remove any IS_LOCK on any attribute that is user-defined.
  
  If there is attribute corruption, the value returned will be '-1'.
  
  Examples:
    > say attrcnt(me)
    You say "20"
    > say words(lattr(me))
    You say "20"
  
  See Also: words(), lattr(), vattrcnt()
  
& VALID()
  Function: valid(<option>, <string>)
  
  This function returns 1 if <string> is valid for <option>, and 0
  if it is not.
  
  The following options are available for the valid function:
     name       - returns '1' if the string is a valid object name
     attrname   - returns '1' if the string is a valid attribute name
     playername - returns '1' if the string is a valid player name.  This 
                  also checks if the player already exists.
     password   - returns '1' if the string is a valid password.
     command    - returns '1' if string is a valid command (or alias).
     function   - returns '1' if string is a valid function.
     ufunction  - returns '1' if string is valid @function/@lfunction.
     flag       - returns '1' if string is a valid flag.
     toggle     - returns '1' if string is a valid toggle.
     qreg       - returns '1' if string is valid qreg label.
     colorname  - returns '1' if string is a valid +name for ansi.
     ansicodes  - always returns '1'.  Meant for Penn compatibility.
     timezone   - returns '1' if string is a valid timezone.
  
  If a valid option is not specified, this function returns #-1.
  
  Examples:
    > say valid(name, Fred)
    You say "1"
    > say valid(name, )
    You say "0"
    > say valid(playername,me)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: isdbref(), name()
  
& VATTRCNT()
  Function: vattrcnt(<object> [,<type>])
  This function counts just the user-defined attributes that exist on
  an object.  User defined attributes are attributes that are set
  with the &attr object=string or @set object=attr:string commands and
  have no @<attribute> ability. (like @va, @desc, etc)
  
  If the <type> is specified to 1, it will reset the vattr count on
  the attribute.  This should never become out of sync with the true
  count on the object.  If there is a discrepency, it usually points
  to larger problems that should be brought to the attention of the
  developers.  This could be caused from improper database writes
  to disk, quota/disk limitations, or possible db corruption.
  
  Examples:
    > say vattrcnt(me)
    You say "14"
    > say attrcnt(me)
    You say "20"
    > say words(lattr(me))
    You say "20"
  
  See Also: words(), lattr(), attrcnt()
  
& TODEC()
  Function: todec(<number>)
  
  Todec converts the inputted number into decimal.  The following formats
  are used to send to it:
 
        0x<number>  - used to specify a hexidecimal number. (base 16) 
        0<number>   - used to specify an octal number.      (base 8)
        0b<number>  - used to specify a binary number.      (base 2)
        <number>    - used to specify standard decimal.     (base 10)
  
  Examples:
    > say todec(011)
    You say "9"
    > say todec(0b11)
    You say "3"
    > say todec(0x11)
    You say "17"
 
  See Also: tohex(), tooct(), tobin()
  
& TOHEX()
  Function: tohex(<number>)
  
  Todec converts the inputted number into hexidecimal.  The following 
  formats are used to send to it:
 
        0x<number>  - used to specify a hexidecimal number. (base 16) 
        0<number>   - used to specify an octal number.      (base 8)
        0b<number>  - used to specify a binary number.      (base 2)
        <number>    - used to specify standard decimal.     (base 10)
  
  Examples:
    > say tohex(017)
    You say "F"
    > say tohex(0b11)
    You say "3"
    > say tohex(-1)
    You say "FFFFFFFF"
 
  See Also: todec(), tooct(), tobin()
  
& TOOCT()
  Function: tooct(<number>)
  
  Tooct converts the inputted number into octal.  The following formats
  are used to send to it:
 
        0x<number>  - used to specify a hexidecimal number. (base 16) 
        0<number>   - used to specify an octal number.      (base 8)
        0b<number>  - used to specify a binary number.      (base 2)
        <number>    - used to specify standard decimal.     (base 10)
  
  Examples:
    > say tooct(11)
    You say "13"
    > say tooct(0b11)
    You say "3"
    > say tooct(0x10)
    You say "20"
 
  See Also: tohex(), todec(), tobin()
  
& TOBIN()
  Function: tobin(<number>)
  
  Todec converts the inputted number into binary.  The following formats
  are used to send to it:
 
        0x<number>  - used to specify a hexidecimal number. (base 16) 
        0<number>   - used to specify an octal number.      (base 8)
        0b<number>  - used to specify a binary number.      (base 2)
        <number>    - used to specify standard decimal.     (base 10)
  
  Examples:
    > say tobin(011)
    You say "00000000000000000000000000001001"
    > say tobin(3)
    You say "00000000000000000000000000000011"
    > say tobin(0x11)
    You say "00000000000000000000000000010001"

& LFLAGS()
  Function: lflags(<object>[/<attribute>])
  
  Lflags works just like flags, but instead of returning the character
  representation will return the string representation.  You may also
  get the flags of the specified attribute.  You may wildcard the 
  attribute and lflags() will return the flags of the first attribute
  matched.
  
  Examples:
    > say lflags(me)
    You say "PLAYER CONNECTED"
    > say flags(me)
    You say "Pc"
    > say lflags(me/desc)
    You say "NOPROG"
    > say flags(me/desc)
    You say "p"
  
  See Also: flags(), hasflag()
  
& findable()
  Function: findable(<object>,<victim>)
   
  This function returns 1 if <object> can locate <victim>, or 0, if
  it cannot. This function takes into account all permissions and
  locational limitations.
  
  Example:
    > say findable(me,me)
    You say "1"
   
  See Also: loc(), where(), visible(), sees()
  
& FLAGS()
  Function: flags(<object>[/<attribute>])
 
  Flags returns a string consisting of the flags attached to the 
  object. The string is, however, just one word.  Note that @switch
  is case-INsensitive.  i.e. p=P as far as it is concerned.  I wish
  that P=NP....
  
  You may also do wildcard flags() matches on attributes.  It will
  only return the first match it finds.  To see what the flag 
  letters are for the attribute flags, see 'help ATTRIBUTE FLAGS'.
  
  Example:
    > say flags(me)
    You say "Pc"
    > say flags(me/desc)
    You say "p"
    > say flags(me/asdfadsfasdfaf)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: lflags(), hasflag()
  
& RNUM()
  Function: rnum(<target>,<object>)
  
  Returns the dbref number of the object, from target's perspective.
  You must control <target> to successfully get the object's number.
  
  Example:
    > say room(me)
    You say "#5"
    > say room(#122) (if #122 is an object that you owned)
    You say "#123"
    > say room(#124) (if #124 is an object that you owned)
    You say "#123"
    > say name(#122)
    You say "thingy"
    > say num(thingy)
    You say "#-1" 
    > say rnum(thingy,#124)
    You say "#122"
  
  See Also: locate(), num()
  
& NUM()
  Function: num(<object>)
 
  Returns the dbref number of the object, which must be in the same 
  room as the object executing num.
  
  Example:
    > say num(me)
    You say "#123"
   
  See Also: locate(), rnum()
  
& CON()
  Function: con(<object>)
   
  Con returns the first object in the list of objects carried by 
  thing. Just the first, and only the first.  See NEXT.
  
  Example:
    > inv
    You are carrying:
    Glove(#123)
    Bat(#124)
    You have 200 gold pieces.
    > say con(me) 
    You say "#123"
  
  See Also: next()
  
& CONFIG()
  Function: config(<parameter>)
   
  With no arguments, this function returns a list of config option names.
  
  Given a config option name, this function returns its value.
  
  The available special arguments can be used:
    0 - show all config options pushing extras on additional stack (default)
    1 - show all config options that can be placed in a single LBUF
  
  Example:
    > say config(money_name_singular) 
    You say 'Gold Piece'
    > say config()
    You say "alt_inventories ... who_wizlevel"     (where ... is a lot of info)
  
  See Also: @list options 
 
& LOC()
  Function: loc(<object>)
 
  Returns the number of the location where <object> is.  You must either
  control the object or be nearby for it to work.  When used on an exit it
  returns the destination of the exit.  You can also use loc() to find the
  location of players that are not set UNFINDABLE.
 
  Example:
    > look
    Mortal's Room(#367R)
    A bare room with nothing in it but a bed and a chair.
    Contents:
    hat(#368)
    > say loc(me)
    You say "#367"
    > enter hat
    hat(#368)
    Contents:
    cat(#325)
    > say loc(me)
    You say "#368"
    > say loc(here)
    You say "#367"
  
  See Also: rloc(), room(), where()
  
& RLOC()
  Function: rloc(<object>,<levels>)
 
  This function may be used to get the location of an object's location
  (for which you would previously use 'loc(loc(<object>))', which fails if you
  don't control <object>'s location).  <levels> indicates the number of
  nested 'loc' calls to make, so 'loc(loc(<object>))' could be replaced with
  'rloc(<object>,2)'.  If rloc() encounters a room, the dbref of the room
  is returned.
 
  You must either control the object or be nearby for it to work.  When used
  on an exit it returns the destination of the exit.  You can also use rloc()
  to find the location of players that are not set UNFINDABLE.
 
  rloc(<object>,0) is the same as num(<object>), and rloc(<object>,1) is the
  same as loc(<object>).
  
  Example:
    > look
    Object(#123p)
    You are inside your object
    > @fo #123=look
    Object> Room(#124R)
    Object> You are inside a room.
    > say loc(me)
    You say "#123"
    > say rloc(me,1)
    You say "#123"
    > say rloc(me,2)
    You say "#124"
  
  See Also: loc(), where()
  
& ERROR()
  Function: error([<target>])
  
  This function takes either no arguments or an optional target player.  
  It returns one of the random error messages in a standard format.  
  If you, or the target specified, have the toggle 'VANILLA_ERRORS' 
  enabled, you will only get the default error message.
  
  If a target is specified, you must control the target player, or
  the target player must exist.  If neither of these conditions are
  met, it defaults back to the enactor (or you) for how the error
  processes.
  
  Example:
    > say error()
    You say "Huh?  (Type 'help' for help.)"
    > say error(*tinyplayer)
    You say "Huh?  (Type 'help' for help.)"
    
  See Also: @toggle
  
& WHERE()
  Function: where(<object>)
 
  This function returns the "true" location of an object. You must control
  the object or be near it in order for it to work. For players and things,
  the "true" location is the normal location of the object. For exits, the
  "true" location is the source room. For rooms, it is #-1.
  
  Example:
    > say where(me)
    You say "#123"
    > say loc(me)
    You say "#123"
   
  See Also: loc(), rloc(), @whereis, @whereall
  
& OWNER()
  Function: owner(<object>)
            owner(<object>/<attrib>)
 
  The first form of the owner() function returns the dbref of the owner of the
  object.  The object must either be yours or nearby.
 
  The second form returns the owner of an attribute on the named object.
  You must own either the object or the attribute.
  
  Example:
    > say owner(me)
    You say "#123"
    > say num(me)
    You say "#123" 
  
  See Also: @chown
  
& CNAME()
  cname(<dbref>)
   
  This function returns the name of the indicated object with any special
  colorization or accents that they may have.  When called with an exit 
  it returns the only the first alias.
  
  Example:
    > say cname(me)
    You say "TinyPlayer"  (this would be colorized and/or accented)
   
  See Also: fullname(), @alias, @name, name()

& NAME()
  name(<dbref>[,<newname>])
   
  This function returns the name of the indicated object.  When called with
  an exit it returns the only the first alias.
  
  If side-effects are enabled, and if this side-effect is enabled, and if
  the target is set SIDEFX, you may use the second option of this to set
  the target dbref with the new name.  All permissions and limitations to
  @name hold true of this side-effect.
  
  Example:
    > say name(me)
    You say "TinyPlayer"
   
  See Also: fullname(), @alias, @name, cname()
  
& FULLNAME()
  Function: fullname(<dbref>)
  
  This function returns the full name of the indicated object.  This is the
  same as name() in all cases except when <dbref> is an exit, then all the
  aliases are returned as well.
  
  Example:
    > look
    A Room(#1234R)
    You see a room.
    Obvious exits:
    An Exit <AE>
    > say exit(here)
    You say "#123"
    > say name(#123)
    You say "An Exit <AE>"
    > say fullname(#123)
    You say "An Exit <AE>;ae;an exit;exit"
  
  See Also: name(), @alias, @name, cname()
  
& NEXT()
  next(<thing>)
 
  If thing is an exit in a room, then next will return the next 
  nondark exit in the list of exits for that room.  If thing is an 
  object, then next will return the next object in the inventory list 
  that the object is in.  Otherwise, it returns a '#-1' string.
    
  Example:
    > inv
    You are carrying:
    Glove(#123)
    Bat(#124)
    You have 200 gold pieces.
    > say con(me) 
    You say "#123"
    > say next(con(me))
    You say "#124"
  
  See Also: con()
  
& CAND()
  Function: cand(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if they are all each equivalent
  to true(1).  Unlike and(), this function stops after the FIRST false
  statement.
  
  Example: 
    > say [cand(1[setq(0,test)],0,1[setq(1,test2)] - [r(0)] / [r(1)]
    You say "1 - test / "
    > say [cand(1[setq(0,test)],1,1[setq(1,test2)] - [r(0)] / [r(1)]
    You say "1 - test / test2"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, or(), not(), xor(), nand(), nor(), xnor(), cor()
  
& AND()
  Function: and(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if they are all each equivalent
  to true(1).
  
  Example:
    > say [and(1,0)] @ [and(0,0)] @ [and(0,1)] @ [and(1,1)]
    You say "0 @ 0 @ 0 @ 1"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, or(), not(), xor(), nand(), nor(), xnor()
  
& COR()
  Function: cor(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if at least one is equivalent
  to true(1).  This works like or() however execution is stopped after the
  FIRST true occurance.
  
  Example: 
    > say [cor(0[setq(0,test)],1,1[setq(1,test2)] - [r(0)] / [r(1)]
    You say "1 - test / "
    > say [cor(0[setq(0,test)],0,1[setq(1,test2)] - [r(0)] / [r(1)]
    You say "1 - test / test2"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), not(), xor(), nand(), nor(), xnor(), cand()
            ofparse()
  
& OR()
  Function: or(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if at least one is equivalent
  to true(1).
  
  Example: 
    > say [or(1,0)] @ [or(0,0)] @ [or(0,1)] @ [or(1,1)]
    You say "1 @ 0 @ 1 @ 1"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), not(), xor(), nand(), nor(), xnor()
  
& NOT()
  Function: not(<boolean>)
 
  Takes a boolean value, and returns its inverse.  So, if the input is
  equivalent to true(1) it returns a 0, and if the input is equivalent to
  false(0), it returns a 1.
  
  Example:
    > say not(1)
    You say "0"
    > say not(0)
    You say "1"
   
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), or(), xor(), nand(), nor(), xnor()
  
& XGET()
  Function: xget(<object>,<attribute>)
   
  The xget function fetches the specified attribute from the named object.
  It can be used to get attributes from objects you own, public and visual
  attributes of objects near you, and public and visual attributes other
  than the description of players wherever they may be.  If the attribute is
  not present on <object>, its parent is searched for the attribute.
   
  Example:
    > read me
    > say xget(me,desc)
    You say "My Desc"
  
  See Also: get_eval(), u(), get()
  
& XOR()
  Function: xor(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if an odd number of them are
  equivalent to true(1).
    
  Example: 
    > say [xor(1,0)] @ [xor(0,0)] @ [xor(0,1)] @ [xor(1,1)]
    You say "1 @ 0 @ 1 @ 0"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), nor(), or(), nand(), xnor()
  
& NOR()
  Function: nor(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
  
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns true(1) if both values are 
  false(0) or false(0) if either or both values are true(1).
    
  Example: 
    > say [nor(1,0)] @ [nor(0,0)] @ [nor(0,1)] @ [nor(1,1)]
    You say "0 @ 1 @ 0 @ 0"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), xor(), or(), nand(), xnor()
  
& NAND()
  Function: nand(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN]...)
  
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns false(0) if both values are
  true(1) and true(1) if either or both values are false(0).
  
  Example: 
    > say [nor(1,0)] @ [nor(0,0)] @ [nor(0,1)] @ [nor(1,1)]
    You say "1 @ 1 @ 1 @ 0"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), xor(), or(), xnor(), nor()
  
& XNOR()
  Function: xnor(<boolean1>,<boolean2>[,<booleanN>]...)
  
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns true(1) if both values are
  true(1) or false(0) and returns false(0) if any one value is
  false(0) but the other(s) are true(1).
  
  Example: 
    > say [xnor(1,0)] @ [xnor(0,0)] @ [xnor(0,1)] @ [xnor(1,1)]
    You say "0 @ 1 @ 0 @ 1"
  
  See Also: BOOLEAN VALUES, and(), xor(), or(), nand(), nor()
  
& gt()
  Function: gt(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if and only if <integer1> is greater than
  <integer2>, and 0 otherwise.  Warning: passing anything but integers will
  produce unexpected results, as non-numeric strings usually are treated
  as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
    > say gt(4,5)
    You say "0"
    > say gt(5,5)
    You say "0"
    > say gt(6,5)
    You say "1"
    > say gt(foo, bar)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lt(), lte(), gte(), eq(), neq()
  
& gte()
  Function: gte(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if and only if <integer1> is greater than
  or equal to <integer2>, and 0 otherwise.  Warning: passing anything but
  integers will produce unexpected results, as non-numeric strings usually are
  treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
    > say gte(4,5)

  as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
    > say lt(4,5)
    You say "1"
    > say lt(5,5)
    You say "0"
    > say lt(6,5)
    You say "0"

    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lte(), gte(), gt(), eq(), neq()
  
& lte()
  Function: lte(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if and only if <integer1> is less than 
  or equal to <integer2>, and 0 otherwise.  Warning: passing anything but 
  integers will produce unexpected results, as non-numeric strings usually 
  are treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
    > say lte(4,5)
    You say "1"
    > say lte(5,5)
    You say "1"

    You say "1"
  
  See Also: lt(), gte(), gt(), eq(), neq()
  
& eq()
  Function: eq(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if they are equal and 0 if they are not.
  Warning: passing anything but integers will produce unexpected results,
  as non-numeric strings usually are treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
    > say eq(1,-1)
    You say "0"
    > say eq(5,5)
    You say "1"
    > say eq(foo, bar)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: lt(), lte(), gte(), gt(), neq()
  
& neq()
  Function: neq(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if they are not equal and 0 if they are
  equal.  Warning: passing anything but integers will produce unexpected
  results, as non-numeric strings usually are treated as numeric 0.
 
  Examples:
    > say neq(1,-1)
    You say "1"
    > say neq(5,5)
    You say "0"
    > say neq(foo, bar)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lt(), lte(), gte(), gt(), eq(), not()
  
& cat()
  Function: cat(<string>[,<stringN>])
 
  cat returns a string made up of the contents of string1 through stringN,
  with each string separated from its neighbors by a space.
 
  Example:
    > say cat(this is, a test)
    You say "this is a test"
    > say cat(This is,another,test of the,CAT function)
    You say "This is another test of the CAT function"
  
  See Also: setunion(), setinter(), strcat()
  
& TOTMEMBER()
  Function: member(<list>, <word>[, <delim>])
  
  Totmember takes a list and a word, and returns the position of every
  matching word in that list.  If the word does not occur in the list, 
  it will return 0.  Unlike totmatch(), totmember() does not check for
  wildcarding.  It only takes a single non-space delimited word as
  the argument for word.  totmember() is case sensitive.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  Example:
    > say totmember(This is a totmember test this is, this)
    You say "6"
    > say totmember(this is a totmember test this is, this)
    You say "1 6"
    > say totmember(This is another test, *e*)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: TOTMATCH(), MATCH(), MEMBER(), NUMMATCH(), NUMMEMBER()
  
& member()
  Function: member(<list>, <word>[, <delim>])
 
  Member takes a list and a word, and returns the position of that word
  within the list.  If the word does not occur in the list, then 0 is
  returned.  Unlike match(), member() does not check for wildcarding,
  and the cases of <list> and <word> are significant.  A word is defined as
  a string which has no interior spaces.  So 'hello' would be one word,
  while 'hello there' would be two.  Member, unlike match, is case 
  sensitive.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
    > say member(This is a member test, member)
    You say "4"
    > say member(This is a member test, Member)
    You say "0"
    > say member(This is a member test, *e*)   
    You say "0"
    > say member(This is a member test, is a)
    You say "#-1 CAN ONLY TEST ONE ELEMENT"
   
  See Also: LISTS, match(), strmatch(), subnetmatch(), nummember(), totmember()
  
& NUMMEMBER()
  Function: nummember(<list>, <word>[, <delim>])
  
  Nummember takes a list and a word and returns the total number of matches
  that word has in the list.  Unlike nummatch(), this function does not 
  check for wildcarding and the cases are significant.  A word is defined
  as a non-space separate string like 'hello' would be a word, but
  'hello world' would be considered two.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  Example:
    > say nummember(This is a test test test repeat a test, test)
    You say "4"
    > say nummember(This is another test, fred)
    You say "0"
    > say nummember(This is a test, *e*)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: nummatch(), totmatch(), totmember(), match(), member()
  
& remove()
  Function: remove(<list>, <word>[, <delim>])
 
  Remove takes a list and a word, and returns the list, with the word deleted
  from it.  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
    > say remove(this is a test, is)
    You say "this a test"
    > say remove(You can't remove, this)
    You say "You can't remove"
    > say remove(You can't remove multiple words, You can't)
    You say "#-1 CAN ONLY DELETE ONE ELEMENT"
    > say remove(How about an o-separated list, w ab, o) 
    You say "Hout an o-separated list"
  
  See Also: mid(), delete()
  
& REBOOTTIME()
  Function: reboottime()
  
  Returns a string which is the time the MUSH last rebooted.  The time
  is in the same format as the TIME() function returns.
  
  Example:
    > say reboottime()
    You say "Sat Dec  7 00:09:13 1991
    
  See Also: convtime(), starttime(), rebootsecs(), startsecs()
  
& STARTTIME()
  Function: starttime()
 
  Returns a string which is the time the MUSH last started.  The time
  is in the same format as the TIME() function returns.
 
  Example:
    > say starttime()
    You say "Sat Dec  7 00:09:13 1991
  
  See Also: convtime(), reboottime(), startsecs(), rebootsecs()
  
& REBOOTSECS()
  Function: rebootsecs()
  
  Returns a string which is the time the MUSH last rebooted in seconds.
  
  Example:
    > say startsecs()
    You say "2324234"
   
  See Also: startime(), secs(), startsecs(), reboottime()
  
& STARTSECS()
  Function: startsecs()
   
  Returns a string which is the time the MUSH last started in seconds.  
  
  Example:
    > say startsecs()
    You say "2324234"

& WRITABLE()
  Function: writable(<player>, <target>/<attrib>)
  
  This function checks if <player> can set attribute <attrib> on target player
  <target>.  You must control <player> otherwise it returns a failure (0).
  
  If <player> or <target> does not exist, it will return a failure (0).
  
  If <attrib> does not exist, it will return a success, but only if the first
  two conditions wouldn't cause a failure.
  
  Example:
    > say writable(bob, fred/desc)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: set(), rset()

& WRAP()
  Function: wrap(<txt>,<width>[,<jst>,[<ltxt>[,<rtxt>[,<hanging>][,<jstcut>]]])
   
  This function word wraps the text to fit into a column of the
  specified width.  Words are separated by spaces. If a word in the text
  is longer than a single line, it is simply broken at the end of the
  line. Tabs are expanded to 8 spaces, and %r's are treated as a force
  to the next line, overriding the logic of the word wrapping. 
  
  <jst> may be any of the following.  You can just use the first character.
     left      - all text is wrapped to the left margen
     right     - all text is wrapped to the right margen
     center    - all text is wrapped to the center
     justified - all text is 'stretched' from the left to right margen.
                 This has a newspaper like effect.
     ignore    - all text is wrapped but padding is ignored.  This is useful
                 to pass into other functions such as printf().
   
  The <ltxt> and <rtxt> specify text to insert as borders on either the left
  side or right side of each line. They default to nothing.
    
  The <hanging> argument specifies an optional number of spaces to insert on
  the left margin for any line that is not the first line. This is commonly
  called a hanging indent in word processing.
  
{ 'help wrap2' for more }
  
& WRAP2
  Function: wrap(<txt>,<width>[,<jst>,[<ltxt>[,<rtxt>[,<hanging>][,<jstcut>]]])
  
  The <jstcut> is used for when the string sent to wrap() isn't as large
  as the width you specified.  If this condition is true, and you use
  'justified' as the justification method, then it will assume a left
  justification for that line.  This is to avoid large spaces between
  strings for the very last line in a wrap().  
   
  Examples:
    > @emit wrap(Hi there. How are you?, 10, right, |%b, %b|)
      |  Hi there. |
      |    How are |
      |       you? |
    
    > @emit DESC: [wrap(get(me/desc), 10, left,,,6)]
      DESC: You see 
            before 
            you a
            stranger.
   
  
  The width can not be above 4000 characters.

  This function has a huge number of uses, and all help will be given to show
  examples for what this function can do.  Unlike the columns() function, this
  one will wrap as many words as possible into a columns.  Like a newspaper.
  The arguments to this function are as follows.
    <txt>    - The text that you will be passing into columns.
    <wd>     - The maximum column size you desire.
    <col>    - The total number of columns you wish per line.
  * <jus>    - The justification of text in the columns (default left) 
               Arguments: (l)eft, (c)enter, (r)ight, or (j)ustified
  * <crp>    - Specifies if you want the columns cropped to the longest word or
               the max columns size whatever is smaller.
               Arguments: 1 to crop, 0 for no cropping (default).
  * <cut>    - Specifies that the word be cut off if over maximum columns size.
               Arguments: 1 to cut, 0 for no cutting (default).
  * <lbd>    - What text you want displayed as the left border of the line.
  * <mbd>    - What text you want as the seperator between columns on the line.
  * <rbd>    - What text you want displayed as the right border of the line.
  * <dsp>    - What display type you want.  Down then over or over then down.
               Arguments: 1 for over then down, 0 for down then over (default)
  * <ext>    - Extension argument.  When toggled to '1' will extend a partial
               row to the maximum column width by padding it with spaces.
               This will use the column separator if the padding requires 
               multiple columns.
  
  Anything with an '*' are optional *only* if the first three args are used.

& PTIMEFMT()
  ptimefmt(<format>[, <secs>])
   
  This function takes a format and a time in seconds (Or the current time)
  and returns the format with escape sequences in it expanded to the
  proper values based on the time, relative to the host the server is
  on.
   
  A list of all codes is in HELP PTIMEFMT2
   
  Example:
  > think ptimefmt($A\, the $dth day of $B.)
    Monday, the 17th day of July.
  
  This function is intended to mimic Penn's timefmt() function.
  
& PTIMEFMT2
  All escape codes start with a $. To get a literal $, use $$.
  Any unrecognized codes or other text will be returned unchanged.
  Some servers might support more codes than the ones listed below.
   
  $a - Abbreviated weekday name  $p - AM/PM  ($P may also work)
  $A - Full weekday name         $S - Seconds after the minute
  $b - Abbreviated month name    $U - Week of the year from 1rst Sunday
  $B - Full month name           $w - Day of the week. 0 = Sunday
  $c - Date and time             $W - Week of the year from 1rst Monday
  $d - Day of the month          $x - Date
  $H - Hour of the 24-hour day   $X - Time
  $I - Hour of the 12-hour day   $y - Two-digit year

  Uses the provided <format string> to output the <secs> in many useful
  ways. The function can be used to interpret <secs> as calendar time,
  or as elapsed time. Due to the many capabilities of this function,
  help for it is broken up into several sections.
  
  You may specify an optional output timezone for the time.  For a
  list of timezones, please see 'help timezone list'.

& TIMEFMT ESCAPES
  To cause the timefmt function to output a '$' character it must be
  repeated twice, example:
    @emit timefmt($$MONEY$$ at $H O'clock,secs())
    SAMPLE OUTPUT: $MONEY$ at 3 O'clock
  
  ADVANCED TIMEFMT ESCAPES
  To cause the timefmt function to output a PROCOPT character from within
  literal text which follows a format sequence which also contains the
  needed PROCOPT character it must be repeated twice. Otherwise, the character
  is a special signal to the timefmt function to tell it that even if a
  field was suppressed due to a 0 value field that you want to override the
  conditional processing for the literal text which follows the PROCOPT
  character. Example:
    @emit timefmt($!g Seconds Elapsed Dude!! Way to go.,conn())
    SAMPLE OUTPUT: 5 Seconds Elapsed Dude! Way to go.
  
  If the '!' character was not doubled in the above example, and the
  $g field equated to 0, then the output would go like this:
    @emit timefmt($!g Seconds Elapsed Dude! Way to go.,0)
    SAMPLE OUTPUT:  Way to go.

& TIMEFMT SYNTAX
     The timefmt format string can contain two types of data. First it can
  contain literal text which is mearly copied to the function's output.
  Second it can contain format sequences. Every format sequence in the
  format string describes a field to be filled in by the timefmt function.
  Fields are by default variable width and right justified.
  A format sequence begins with a '$' character and is followed by an 
  optional left justification character ('-'),
  a field width, and a mandatory format specifier. The syntax can be
  described visually as follows: $[-][FIELDWIDTH]FORMATSPEC
  
     A field width is specified as a sequence of digits representing the
  required width of the field. If a field width number begins with a 
  '0' the field will be zero padded, the default is to pad with spaces.
  
     An example of a format sequence would be '$-5M' which would print the
  month name left justified in a field with a width of 5. Should the month
  name be longer than 5 then the name will be truncated.
  
  See Also: timefmt syntax2
  
& TIMEFMT SYNTAX2
     Should it be necessary to use a '$' without wishing it to be interpreted
  as the start of a format sequence, use two '$' characters in a row as in
  '$$'. These two will be compressed into one literal '$'.
  
     There are other advanced features in the syntax which are not described
  here so as not to confuse the basic topic.
  
  See Also: timefmt, timefmt advanced, timefmt escapes
  
& TIMEFMT ADVANCED
     The advanced syntax of the timefmt format string adds the ability to 
  do special processing for 0 valued fields. The new format sequence looks 
  like: $[PROCOPT][-][FIELDWIDTH]FORMATSPEC
  
     The PROCOPT character is one of the following:
        '!' - Don't print field if value is 0
        '~' - Don't print field if value is 0, but pad w/ spaces to fld width
        '@' - Only print field if current field value or a previous
              field value was not 0
        '#' - Only print field if current field value or a previous
              field value was not 0, but pad w/ spaces to fld width
  
     If a field is not printed, the copying of any literal text following
  the format specifier is suppressed until the next format sequence at which
  point copying is turned back on. You can turn the copying function back on
  at any point in the literal text which follows a sequence with a PROCOPT
  by repeating the same PROCOPT character at the point in the literal text
  which you want copying to be always on.

& TIMEFMT ADVANCED2
  With the '~' and '#' PROCOPT types, any literal text which was turned 
  off by a 0 value field will be substituted by spaces. This keeps text 
  aligned in columns. Should one of the PROCOPT characters be needed as 
  a literal text character following a field that contains a PROCOPT, 
  the character can be escaped by doubling it, IE '@@' would print '@'
  if it was embedded in text which followed a sequence like $@G.

& TIMEFMT ADVANCED EXAMPLE
  The following examples take an elapsed time (which is hard coded as the
  second argument for illustration purposes) and format it in such a way
  that any fields which are irrelevant are eliminated. Several examples
  are shown with the same format string and different <secs> argument to 
  illustrate how the output changes depending on this input. Note the 
  '#' character following 'secs' in the format string, this ensures
  that even if the $#G field is 0 and the 'secs' text is not printed that
  the ' <-' text will still be printed.
  
    timefmt(Elapsed -> $#2c days $#2X hours $#2F mins $#G secs# <-, 111111111)
    OUTPUT: Elapsed -> 12 days  0 hours 11 mins 51 secs <-
  
    timefmt(Elapsed -> $#2c days $#2X hours $#2F mins $#G secs# <-, 11111)
    OUTPUT: Elapsed ->          3 hours  5 mins 11 secs <-
  
    timefmt(Elapsed -> $#2c days $#2X hours $#2F mins $#G secs# <-, 1111)
    OUTPUT: Elapsed ->                  18 mins 31 secs <-
  
  Now note how the output changes with the '@' PROCOPT used instead of '#':
    timefmt(Elapsed -> $@2c days $@2X hours $@2F mins $@G secs@ <-, 1111)
    OUTPUT: Elapsed -> 18 mins 31 secs <-
  
  The '~' and '!' PROCOPT characters operate similarly but they only pay
  attention to the current field being 0 or not.

& TIMEFMT CODELIST2
  Syntax:   timefmt($<code> $<code> ... $<code>,<time-in-seconds>)
  
  Example:  ---[timefmt($!2cd$02X:$02F,conn(me))]---
  Output:   --- 3d12:03---
  
  Description: This tells to format the time and to display the day field only
               if this value is non-zero, then return the hours and minutes, 
               in a time format (IE: ##:## - the 02 says pad with zeroes a 
               total of two spaces no matter the result).  It then passes the 
               total time you were connected (the conn() function) into the 
               format you specified for timefmt(). Broken up, these codes are:
  
  Details:  $!2cd - $ tells timefmt() it's a special timefmt() code.
                    ! tells it to not print this field if zero
                   2c tells it to print a two character field and pad with
                      a space if the value is less than two characters.
                      If you use $!02cd it would return '03d' instead of ' 3d'
            $02X  - $ tells timefmt() it's a special timefmt() code.
                  02X tells it to print the hour field and pad with zeroes if
                      the total character count is less than two. IE: '06'
            $02F  - $ tells timefmt() it's a special timefmt() code.
                  02F tells it to print the minute field and pad with zeroes 
                      if the total character count is less than two. IE: '12'
  
& SECS()
  Function: secs()
 
  Returns the number of elapsed seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970.
  This is an easy way to time things.
 
  Example:
     > say secs()
     You say "692636020"
     ... wait a bit ...
     > say secs()
     You say "692636043"
  
  See Also: convsecs(), convtime(), time(), timefmt()
  
& WORDS()
  Function:  words(<string>[, <delim>])
            mwords(<string>[, <multi-character-delim>])
   
  Returns the number of words in <string>.  <delim> may be used to specify
  a delimiter other than a space.  mwords() works just like words, except
  that ignores ansi and allows a multi-character delimiter.
   
  Example:
    > say words(This is a test)
    You say "4"
    say words(Would you like coffee or perhaps tea?)
    > You say "7"
    say words(This:is:a:colon:separated:list,:)
    > You say "6"
  
  See Also: wordpos(), strlen(), extract(), extractword()
  
& VERSION()
  Function: version(<arg>)
 
  Returns a string which contains various version information for the MUSH
  you're on.
  
  Optional arguments are:
    0 - Show the version of RhostMUSH running (default)
    1 - Show the build date of RhostMUSH
 
  Example:
     > version
     RhostMUSH Version 3.5 patchlevel 0 #3
     Build date: Thu Dec  5 10:10:07 EST 1991
     > say version()
     You say "RhostMUSH Version 3.5 patchlevel 0 #3"
  
  See Also: version
  
& HOME()
  home(<object>)
 
  Returns the object's home.
 
  Example:
    > exam me
    Mortal(#226Pc)
    Type: PLAYER Flags: CONNECTED
    Desc:Just a plain, old boring Mortal. You know.
    Owner: Mortal  Key: VA:foobar Clams: 920
    Last:Thu Dec 19 08:57:21 1991
    Home: Mortal's Room(#367R)
    Location: The Town Square
    > say home(me)
    You say "#367"
  
  See Also: loc(), room(), @link
  
& MONEY()
  Function: money(<object>)
 
  Returns an integer equal to the amount of money <object> has (if it is a
  player) or is worth (otherwise).
  
  Example:
    > score
    You have 1052 clams.
    > say money(me)
    You say "1052"
    > exam sac test
    Sac Test(#287V)
    Type: THING Flags: VISUAL
    Owner: Beaker  Key: *UNLOCKED* Clams: 20
    Home: Limbo(#0RLDAJ)
    Location: The Town Square
    > say money(sac test)
    You say "20"
  
  See Also: score, COSTS, moneyname()
  
& MONEYNAME()
  Function: moneyname([<value>])
  
  This function returns the singular or plural value of the money notation
  defined by the game.  This takes an optional value passed into it for
  singular notation (the default) or plural notation (if less than -1,
  greater than 1, or equal to 0).  If the value is empty, it returns the
  singular notation.
  
  Examples:
    > say moneyname()
    You say "Gold Piece"
    > say moneyname(0)
    You say "Gold Pieces"
    > score
    You have 1 Gold Piece.
    > say [money(me)] [moneyname(money(me))]
    You say "1 Gold Piece"
    > say 50 [moneyname(50)]
    You say "50 Gold Pieces"
  
  See Also: score, money()
  
& MOON()
  Function: moon([<seconds>] [,<key>])
  
  The moon function returns the phase of the moon for the specified time.  If
  no time is specified, it returns the moon phase for the current time.
  
  If the 'key' value is '1', then it just returns the percentage of the moon.
  
  Example:
    > say moon()
    You say "The Moon is Waning Crescent (20% of Full)"
    > say moon(999999999)
    You say "The Moon is Waning Gibbous (72% of Full)"
  
  See Also: time(), secs(), timefmt()
  
& LCON()
  Function: lcon(<object>[/switch] [,<switch>][,<output seperator>][,0|1)])
 
  Returns a space-separated list of the contents of <object>.
  It takes specific switches as an option:
      /PLAYER  -- lists all TYPE players in the contents.
      /OBJECT  -- lists all TYPE objects in the contents.
      /CONNECT -- lists all connected players in the contents.
      /PUPPET  -- lists all flag type 'PUPPET' in the contents.
      /LISTEN  -- lists all listening things in the contents.
  
  You may optionally specify the switch as the second argument, without 
  the '/' before it, to do the same thing.  This will cause any /switch
  you have in the first argument to assume it's part of the object name.
  The function takes an output seperator as an optional third argument.

  If the optional last argument is set to 1, lcon will display the object
  names instead of the #dbrefs.

  By default, Rhost returns '#-1' if lcon() returns no objects. If the
  config option mux_lcon_compat is set to '1', lcon() will return an empty
  string instead, for MUX compatibility.
  
  Example:
    > inv
    t1(#366)
    radio(#223p)
    > say lcon(me)
    You say "#366 #223"
    > say lcon(me/puppet)
    You say "#223"
    > say lcon(me,puppet)
    You say "#223"
  
  See Also: lexits(), @dolist
  
& XCON()
  Function: xcon(<object>[/switch],<start>,<count> [,<switch>])
  
  This function is similiar to lcon() except it returns a space-seperated list
  of the contents of <object> starting at point <start> and returning <count>
  number of contents.  It takes a specific switch as an option:
      /PLAYER  -- lists all TYPE players in the contents.
      /OBJECT  -- lists all TYPE objects in the contents.
      /CONNECT -- lists all connected players in the contents.
      /PUPPET  -- lists all flag type 'PUPPET' in the contents.
      /LISTEN  -- lists all listening things in the contents.
  
  You may optionally specify the switch as the second argument, without 
  the '/' before it, to do the same thing.  This will cause any /switch
  you have in the first argument to assume it's part of the object name.
  
{ type 'help xcon2' for examples }
  
& XCON2
  Function: xcon(<object>[/switch],<start>,<count>)  (continued)
  
  Example:
    > inv
    t1(#366)
    radio(#223p)
    The Wizard's Pointy Hat(#188S0)
    A red rose(#1234C)
    Spybot(#2672p)
    You have 1086 Gold Coins.
    > say lcon(me)
    You say "#366 #223 #188 #1234 #2672"
    > say xcon(me,2,2)
    You say "#223 #188"
    > say lcon(me/puppet)
    You say "#223 #2672"
    > say xcon(me/puppet,2,1)
    You say "#2672"
    > say xcon(me,2,1,puppet)   
    You say "#2672"
  
  See Also: lexits(), lcon()
  
& LEXITS()
  Function: lexits(<loc>[,<output seperator>][,0|1)][<key>])
 
  Returns a space-separated list of the exits in <loc> and its parents.
  Dark exits are not returned unless you own the location.
  Parented exits that are set PRIVATE will not be displayed.
  The function takes an output seperator as an optional second argument.
 
  If the last optional argument is 1, lexits will display object names
  instead of #dbrefs.
  
  The following optional keys are available:
    0 - list all children of the target (default)
    n - List 'n'th 400 children of the target. 
        NOTE: 'n' will be any number from 1 to however many 'pages'
              So '1' would be first 400, '2' would be second 400, etc.
    l - List total pages and total children of target.
     
  Example:
    > look here
    The Town Square
    You are in the town square.  All around you .....
    Obvious exits:
    foo  up  southeast  sw  north  
    > say lexits(here)
    You say "#302 #10 #9 #8 #6"
  
  See Also: lcon(), @dolist, PARENT OBJECTS
  
& lrand()
  Function: lrand(<lower>,<upper>,<count>,[,<output delim>])
   
  This function returns a total of '<count>' elements between the
  numbers '<lower>' and '<upper>'.  It may also choose the lower and
  upper numbers for the list it generates.  If no output seperator
  (output delim) is specified, a space is used by default.
   
  Example:
    > say lrand(3,20,5)         (generate 5 numbers >= 3 and <= 20)
    You say "6 18 7 4 19"
    > say lrand(1,6,3)          (generate 3 numbers >= 1 and <= 6)
    You say "1 4 6"
   
  See Also: rand(), dice(), lnum(), lnum2()
  
& lrooms()
  Function: lrooms(<loc> [,<iteration> [,<type>]])
  
  This function returns from 1 to MAXIMUM level of iterations of rooms
  connected to the target <loc> room.  The MAXIMUM level is hypothetically
  the total number of rooms contained on the MUSH.  You can only get rooms
  from visible exits or that you control, are set ABODE, JUMP_OK, LINK_OK, or
  VISIBLE.  Unfortunately, the list of rooms are not in order of iteration,
  or any particular order.  
  
  The iteration defaults to 1.  '0' specifies 'MAXIMUM'.
  
  You may specify the type of display you wish.  A type of '1' (the default) 
  displays all rooms.  A type of '0' will display only the rooms matching 
  the directly specified iteration level, and none before.  Keep in mind 
  that type '0' is not always guaranteed to be absolutely accurate as rooms 
  could be linked differently based on the order it's checked.
  
  Examples:
    > say lrooms(here,1)
    You say "#191 #101"
    > say lrooms(here)
    You say "#191 #101"
    > say lrooms(here,2)
    You say "#191 #101 #19 #0 #1012 #10102"
    > say lrooms(here,2,0)
    You say "#19 #0 #1012 #10102"
  
  See Also: room(), lexits()
  
& SECURE()
  Function: secure(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> after replacing the characters [](){};%\$, with spaces.
  This prevents strings entered by players from causing undesired side
  effects when used, such as making your object perform unintended commands
  or give out information to which you have access.  Note that this function
  is only needed when the resulting string is to be passed through the @force
  command or be used as an attribute for an object (like the success message
  for a mail message object).
 
  Examples:
    > @va me=Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)]
    > say secure(%va)
    You say "Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc...  get #1/desc  "
    > say secure($foobar:this {is} a really, tough ; test.)
    You say " foobar:this is a really tough   test."
 
  Note: 'say secure(Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)])' does not
  produce the expected result because the argument is evaluated BEFORE being
  processed by secure(), therefore the [get()] call has already been
  performed.
  
  See Also: escape(), escapex()
  
& SECUREX()
  function: securex(<string> [,<omission>])
  
  This functions exactly like secure(), except you may specify what characters
  you do not wish to be secured out.
  
  Examples:
    > @va me=Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)]
    > say securex(%va)
    You say "Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc...  get #1/desc  "
    > say securex($foobar:this {is} a really, tough ; test.,;)
    You say " foobar:this is a really tough ; test."
    > @va me=%rTest?  Yes, a test.
    > say securex(v(va),\%)
    You say "%rTest?  Yes  a test.
    > say securex(v(va),\%\,)
    You say "%rTest?  Yes, a test.
  
  See Also: secure(), escape(), escapex()
  
& ESCAPE()
  Function: escape(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> after adding an escape character (\) at the start of the
  string and also before each of the characters %;[]{}\ that appear in the
  string.  This prevents strings entered by players from causing undesired
  side effects when used, such as making your object perform unintended
  commands or give out information to which you have access.  Note that this
  function is only needed when the resulting string is to be passed through
  the @force command or be used as an attribute for an object (like the
  success message for a mail message object).  This function has the 
  advantage over the secure() function in that the string the user sees
  after evaluating it is the same as the original string.
 
  Example:
    > say escape(Sneak a peak at Wiz's desc... [get($1/desc)])
    You say "\Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... \[get\(#1/desc\)\]"
 
  Note: 'say escape(Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)])' does not
  produce the expected result because the argument is evaluated BEFORE being
  processed by escape(), therefore the [get()] call has already been
  performed.
  
  See Also: secure(), securex(), escapex()
  
& ESCAPEX()
  Function: escapex(<string> [,<omission>])
  
  This functions exactly like escape(), except you may specify what characters
  you wish to omit from being escaped through <omition>.  You may specify 'f'
  in the omission to omit the first escape (backslash) from the string.
  
  Example:
    > say escapex(Hey, Sneak a peak at Wiz's desc... [get($1/desc)],\[\])
    You say "\Hey \,Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get\(#1/desc\)]"
  
  See Also: escape(), secure(), securex()
  
& MUDNAME()
  Function: mudname()
 
  Returns the name of the MUD.  This is usually (but not necessarily) the name
  that appears in the various mud lists, and is the name that the mud is
  listed under in reports from RWHO servers (that is, if the mud sends its
  WHO information to an RWHO server).
 
  Example:
    > say mudname()
    You say "RhostMUSH"
  
  See Also: version(), version
  
& CAPSTR()
  Function: capstr(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> with the first character capitalized.  If the first
  character is not a letter, this function returns the string unmodified.
 
  Example:
    > say capstr(this is a string I want capitalized)
    You say "This is a string I want capitalized"
  
  See Also: lcstr(), ucstr(), caplist()

& CAPLIST()
  Function: caplist(<list>[,<delim>[,<osep>[,<key>[,<type>]]]])

  Returns <list> with the first character of each word capitalized.  You may
  specify an optional <delim> as a delimiter for the list input, otherwise the
  default of space will be used.  You may also specify an optional <osep>
  as a separator for the list that is returned.
  
  Additionally, an optional <key> may be specified which alters the behavior
  of the function slightly.  The key must be one of the following characters:
    - L:    Reduces the entire list to lower case before capitalization is
            performed.
    - N:    Performs capitalization naturally, and does not affect any other
            characters in the list (default).
    - T:    Performs a 'true' capitalization based on currently English
            definition for titles.
  
  A <type> of '1' will work with <key> values of 'L' or 'T' to optionally 
  capitalize all words contained in a hyphon, optionally.  The default
  behavior is to capitalize only the start of the word.  This <type> value
  has no influence on the 'N' <key> type.
   
  Example:
    > say caplist(the mAn in thE mOon).
    You say "The MAn In ThE MOon."

    > say caplist(the mAn in thE mOon,,|,L).
    You say "The|Man|In|The|Moon."

& LCSTR()
  Function: lcstr(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> with all letters converted to lowercase.
 
  Example:
    > say lcstr(This is something I want to TEST)
    You say "this is something I want to test"
  
  See Also: capstr(), ucstr()
  
& UCSTR()
  Function: ucstr(<string>)

    You say "THIS IS A TEST, REALLY!"
  
  See Also: capstr(), lcstr()
  
& LNUM()
  Function: lnum(<number>[,<number>,<seperator>,<stepping>])
 
  Returns a list of numbers from 0 to <number>-1.
  If a second number is specified it tells to use
  the range of numbers between the two values.
  The order you put it in specifies if it increments
  or decrements the value.  You may specify a stepping
  value for the list.
 
  Example:
    > say lnum(5) 
    You say "0 1 2 3 4"
    > say lnum(5,10)
    You say "5 6 7 8 9 10"
    > say lnum(5,10,,2)
    You say "5 7 9"
    > say lnum(7,3)
    You say "7 6 5 4 3"
    > say lnum(1,5,@)
    You say "1@2@3@4@5"
  
  See Also: lnum2()
  
& LNUM2()
  Function: lnum2(<number>[,<number>,<arg>,<stepping>])
  
  Returns a list of numbers from 0 to <number>-1.
  The optional second number tells what number
  to start at. The arg is to tell it to
  increment(+) or decrement(-) the values.  The
  default argument is increment.  You may specify a
  stepping value for the list.
  
  Example:
    > say lnum2(5)
    You say "0 1 2 3 4"
    > say lnum2(10,5,+)
    You say "5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14"
    > say lnum2(10,5,+,2)
    You say "5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23"
    > say lnum2(10,20,-)
    You say "20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11"
  
  See Also: lnum()
  
& LAST()
  Function: last(<list> [,<delim>])
  
  This function returns the last element in the list.  You may specify an 
  optional seperator (delim), otherwise a default of a space is used.
  
  Examples:
    > say last(this is a test)
    You say "test"
    > say last(one@two@three,@)
    You say "three"
  
  See Also: first(), extract(), extractword(), randextract(), elements()
  
& LCMDS()
  Function: lcmds(<object> [,<output delim> [,<type>]])
  
  This function returns the name of any command that exits on the
  object.  You may specify $-commands or ^-listens to search for.
  The output seperator defaults at a space, but you may wish to
  specify a delimiter as commands may contain spaces.
  The following types exist:
    $ - list all commands on the target object.
    ^ - list all listens (of the ^ variety) on the target object.
  
  Examples:
    > @va thing=$test:@pemit %#=testing 1 2 3
    > @vb thing=$test * test *:@pemit %#=You tested %0 with %1.
    > @vc thing=^* says *:@pemit %#=%0 said %1.
    > say lcmds(thing)
    You say "test test * test *"
    > say lcmds(thing,|)
    You say "test|test * test *"
    > say lcmds(thing,,^)
    You say "* says *"
    > say lcmds(thing,|,^)
    You say "* says *"

& LATTR()
  Function: lattr(<obj>[/<wild>][,<targ> [,<type>][,<flg>][,<regexp>][,<tree>])
 
  Returns a list of the attributes set on <obj>.  If <wild> is given, only
  attributes matching it are returned.  If you specify <regexp> as true (1)
  then the wildcard pattern may be regular expressions.  You may specify the 
  optional target if you wish to return attributes that only the target
  could see.  If you do not have control over target, it defaults to yours.
  If the <tree> option is set to '1', it returns attributes based on Penn's
  trees. 
   
  You may specify a type to check against.  The following types exist:
    + - List existing lock attributes on player.
    $ - list all attributes that are $commands.
    ^ - list all attributes that are ^listens.
    & - list all attributes that contain all attribute flags <flags>.
    | - list all attributes that contain any attribute flags <flags>.
    l - list total attributes and pages of attributes.
    # - page (1, 2, etc) for attribute listing.  118 for 32byte attrs.
    > - find the alphanumerical largest attribute name.
    < - find the alphanumerical smallest attribute name.
    ~ - [~#1-#2] list attribs starting at #1 until count of #2.

& FLIP()
  Function: flip(<string>)
 
  Reverses the order of the characters of <string>.
 
  Examples:
    > say flip(This is a test)
    You say "tset a si sihT"
    > say flip(This is a test, Really...)
    You say "...yllaeR ,tset a si sihT"
    > say flip(A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama!)
    You say "!amanaP -- lanac a ,nalp a ,nam A"
  
  See Also: revwords()
  
& REVERSE()
  Function: reverse(<string>)
 
  Reverses the order of the characters of <string>.
 
  Examples:
    > say reverse(This is a test)
    You say "tset a si sihT"
    > say reverse(This is a test, Really...)
    You say "...yllaeR ,tset a si sihT"
    > say reverse(A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama!)
    You say "!amanaP -- lanac a ,nalp a ,nam A"
  
  See Also: revwords()
  
& REVWORDS()
  Function: revwords(<string>[, <delim>])
 
  Reverses the order of the words of <string>.  A word is considered to be
  any sequence of nonblank characters, separated by blanks, so punctuation
  characters that follow a word are considered part of the word.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Examples:
    > say revwords(This is a test\, Really...)
    You say "Really... test, a is This"
    > say revwords(Was it a cat I saw?)
    You say "saw? I cat a it Was"
  
  See Also: reverse()
  
& BEFORE()
  Function: before(<string1>, <string2> [,<key>])
 
  Returns the portion of <string1> that occurs before <string2>.  If <string2>
  does not occur in <string1>, the entire string is returned.
  If you want to return the portion of the string after the first space,
  use the first() function instead.  This function is case sensitive.
  
  You may specify a <key> of 1 to disable ansi handling which will speed
  this function up.  The default is '0' which allows ansi handling.
  
  Note: the config param 'ansi_default' handles if the ansi handling is 
        configured default or not.  In which case the 'key' is reversed.
   
  Examples:
    > say before(This is a test,a)
    You say "This is "
    > say before(This is a test,is)
    You say "Th"
    > say before(This is a test, nope) 
    You say "This is a test"
  
  See Also: after(), first(), rest()
  
& RACE()
  Function: race(<user>)
  
  Returns the race the given user currently has.  This works similar to
  get(<user>/race)
  
  Example:
    > say race(me)
    You say "Human"
  
  See Also: get(), u(), u2(), guild()
  
& GUILD()
  Function: guild(<user>)
  
  Returns the guild the given user currently has.  This works similar to
  get(<user>/guild).
  
  Example:
    > say guild( me )
    You say "Citizen"
  
  See Also: get(), u(), u2(), race()
  
& PORT()
  Function: port(<user>)
  
  Returns the ports a given user is on from most recent to least recent.
  
  Example:
    > say port( me )
    You say "12"
    > say port( me ) <if you're on twice>
    You say "12 15"
  
  See Also: idle(), conn(), lwho(), @selfboot
  
& AFTER()
  Function: after(<string1>, <string2> [,<key>])
 
  Returns the portion of <string1> that occurs after <string2>.  If <string2>
  does not occur in <string1>, a null string is returned.
  If you want to return the portion of the string after the first space,
  use the rest() function instead.  This function is case sensitive.
  
  You may specify a <key> of 1 to disable ansi handling which will speed
  this function up.  The default is '0' which allows ansi handling.
  
  Note: the config param 'ansi_default' handles if the ansi handling is 
        configured default or not.  In which case the 'key' is reversed.
   
  Examples:
    > say after(This is a test,a)
    You say " test"
    > say after(This is a test,is)
    You say " is a test"
    > say after(This is a test, nope)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: before(), first(), rest()
  
& ROOM()
  Function: room(<obj>)
 
  Returns the number of the room that <obj> is in, or would be in if it
  executed LEAVE commands until it got to a room.  You can find out the
  containing room of objects you own, nearby objects, and findable players.
 
  Example:
    > I
    You are carrying:
    hat(#368)
    cat(#325)
    > look
    Mortal's Room(#367R)
    A bare room with nothing in it but a bed and a chair.
    > say I am in [room(me)], the cat is in room [room(cat)].
    You say "I am in #367, the cat is in room #367."
    > @fo hat=get cat 
    cat has left.
    > say The cat is in [loc(#325)] within room [room(#325)].
    You say "The cat is in #368 within room #367."
  
  See Also: loc(), rloc(), lrooms(), UNFINDABLE
  
& SEARCH()
  Function: search([<player>] [<class>=<restriction>[,<low>[,<high>]]])
 
  The search() function returns a list of objects that match the search
  criteria, which are the same as with the @search command.  This function
  costs as much as the @search command, so repeated use is expensive.
 
  Caution: if you use the [ and ] characters in an Eval selection you will
  need to escape them.
 
  Examples:
    > say search()
    You say "#226 #289 #325 #364 #368 #369"
    > @stats me
    6 objects = 0 rooms, 0 exits, 5 things, 1 players. (0 garbage)
    > say search(eval=\[eq(money(##),1)\])
    You say "#289 #325 #364 #368 #369"
    > say search(player=wizard)
    You say "#1"
  
  See Also: searchng(), @search, @find, @stat, SEARCH CLASSES

& SEARCHNG()
  Function: searchng([<player>] [<class>=<restriction>[,<low>[,<high>]]])
  
  This function works exactly as search(), except it will not return any
  garbage (going/recover) objects in the results.
  
  Examples:
    > say searchng()
    You say "#226 #289 #325 #364 #368 #369"
  
  See Also: search(), @search, @find, @stat, SEARCH CLASSES
  
& STATS()
  Function: stats([<player>])
 
  This function returns information about the number of objects on the MUSH,
  much like the @stats command.  If the argument is omitted or is 'all', then
  the stats for the entire MUSH are returned, otherwise the stats for the
  named player are returned.  You can only get stats for yourself.
 
  The stats are returned as a set of 6 numbers, in the same order as reported
  by the @stats command: total objects, rooms, exits, things, players, and
  garbage.  This command costs as much as the equivalent @stats command (IE:
  '@stats/all' or '@stats <player>', not the free '@stats').
 
  Examples:
    > @stats me
    6 objects = 0 rooms, 0 exits, 5 things, 1 players. (0 garbage)
    > say stats(me)
    You say "6 0 0 5 1 0"
    > say stats()
    You say "377 51 165 134 20 7"
    > @stats/all
    377 objects = 51 rooms, 165 exits, 134 things, 20 players. (7 garbage)

& ITEXT()
  Function: itext(<n> [,<key>])
  Related:  inum(<n> [,<key>])
            ibreak(<n>)
            ilev()
   
  These functions, when called within an iter(), return the equivalent
  of ## (itext) or #@ (inum), with reference to the nth more outermost
  iter(), where n=0 refers to the current iter(), n=1 to an iter()
  in which the current iter() is nested, etc.
  
  itext() and inum() can specify a key of '1' to substitute the 
  @dolist/inline value instead of the iter() value essentially duplicating
  '%d<n>' instead of the default '%i<n>'.
   
  Examples:
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, #@:##))]
  You say, "1:red 1:red 2:blue 2:blue 3:green 3:green"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(1)]:[itext(1)]))]
  You say, "1:red 1:red 2:blue 2:blue 3:green 3:green"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(0)]:[itext(0)]))]
  You say, "1:fish 2:shoe 1:fish 2:shoe 1:fish 2:shoe"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [itext(1)]:[itext(0)]))]
  You say, "red:fish red:shoe blue:fish blue:shoe green:fish green:shoe"
  
  See Also: iter(), inum(), ilev(), ibreak(), list()
  
& ILEV()
  Function: ilev()
  Related:  inum(<n> [,<key>])
            ibreak(<n>)
            itext(<n> [,<key>])
  
  This function goes along with inum() and itext() and will return the
  level of recursion you are currently in an iter.  The first level is 
  '0', and deeper levels are 1 and more.
  
  itext() and inum() can specify a key of '1' to substitute the 
  @dolist/inline value instead of the iter() value essentially duplicating
  '%d<n>' instead of the default '%i<n>'.
  
  Example:
    > say iter(a b c,iter(1 2 3,iter(! @ #,ilev())))
    You say "2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2"
  
  This example shows that the ilev() is in the 3rd (starting at 0)
  level of iter.
  
  See Also: inum(), itext(), iter(), ibreak(), list()
  
& INUM()
  Function: inum(<n> [,<key>])
  Related:  itext(<n> [,<key>])
            ibreak(<n>)
            ilev()
   
  These functions, when called within an iter(), return the equivalent
  of ## (itext) or #@ (inum), with reference to the nth more outermost
  iter(), where n=0 refers to the current iter(), n=1 to an iter()
  in which the current iter() is nested, etc.
  
  itext() and inum() can specify a key of '1' to substitute the 
  @dolist/inline value instead of the iter() value essentially duplicating
  '%d<n>' instead of the default '%i<n>'.
   
  Examples:
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, #@:##))] 
  You say, "1:red 1:red 2:blue 2:blue 3:green 3:green"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(1)]:[itext(1)]))]
  You say, "1:red 1:red 2:blue 2:blue 3:green 3:green"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(0)]:[itext(0)]))]
  You say, "1:fish 2:shoe 1:fish 2:shoe 1:fish 2:shoe"
   
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [itext(1)]:[itext(0)]))]
  You say, "red:fish red:shoe blue:fish blue:shoe green:fish green:shoe"
  
  See Also: iter(), itext(), ilev(), ibreak(), list()

& IBREAK()
  Function: ibreak(<n>)
  Related:  itext(<n> [,<key>])
            inum(<n> [,<key>])
            ilev()
  
  These functions, when called with an iter(), return the equivalent
  of ## (itext) or #@ (inum), with reference to the nth more outermost
  iter(), where n=0 refers to the current iter(), n=1 to an iter()
  in which the current iter() is nested, etc.
  
  The ibreak() function is used to break out of the given iter() loop.
  It will finish processing of what it currently is executing then abort
  any further iterations of that given iter loop.  You can specify the nth
  argument to specify which iter() you wish to break out of.
  
  itext() and inum() can specify a key of '1' to substitute the 
  @dolist/inline value instead of the iter() value essentially duplicating
  '%d<n>' instead of the default '%i<n>'.
  
  Examples:
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(1)]:[itext(1)]))]
  You say, "1:red 1:red 2:blue 2:blue 3:green 3:green"
  
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(1)]:[itext(1)][ibreak(1)]))]
  You say, "1:red 1:red"
  
  > say [iter(red blue green,iter(fish shoe, [inum(1)]:[itext(1)][ibreak(0)]))]
  You say, "1:red 2:blue 3:green"
  
  See Also: iter(), itext(), ilev(), inum(), list()

  
& ITER()
  Function: iter(<list>, <eval>[, <delim> [, <output seperator>]])
 
  <list> is a <delimiter>-separated list of strings, which can be object
  numbers, attributes, or arbitrary words.  <eval> is a string that is to be
  evaluated once for each item in <list>, replacing the special symbol ## with
  the corresponding item from <list>.  A space-separated list of the results
  of these evaluations is returned to the caller.  The effect is very similar
  to @dolist, except that the results are made into a list and returned, not
  executed.  The special symbol #@ can be used to return the positional match
  of the current item of the list.  You may specify a filler for the string.
  
  You may use %i0-%i9 for itext(0) to itext(9).  
  You may use %il for the outermost layer, equiv to itext(ilev())
   
  Examples:
    > say iter(This is a test,-## #@-)
    You say "-This 1- -is 2- -a 3- -test 4-"
    > say iter(This is a test,strlen(##))
    You say "4 2 1 4"
    > say iter(lnum(10),mul(mul(##,##),10))
    You say "0 10 40 90 160 250 360 490 640 810"
    > say iter(Was it a cat I saw,words(##),s)
    You say "1 4 1"
    > say iter(This is a test,##,,***)
    You say "This***is***a***test"
    > say iter(This is a test,%i0,,***)
    You say "This***is***a***test"

& NSITER()
  Function: nsiter(<list>, <eval>[, <delim>])
 
  <list> is a <delimiter>-separated list of strings, which can be object
  numbers, attributes, or arbitrary words.  <eval> is a string that is to be
  evaluated once for each item in <list>, replacing the special symbol ## with
  the corresponding item from <list>.  A NONspace-separated list of the 
  results of these evaluations is returned to the caller.  The effect is very 
  similar to @dolist, except that the results are made into a list and 
  returned, not executed.  The special symbol #@ can be used to return the
  positional match of the current item of the list.
  
  This function can be reproduced with iter(<list>,<eval>,<delim>,) and as 
  such is considered depreciated but left for compatibility.
  
  This function does not handle itext/inum/%i.  Use iter() for this.
   
  Examples:
    > say nsiter(lnum(3),--+#@)
    You say "--+1--+2--+3--+4"
    > say nsiter(lnum(4),--+)
    You say "--+--+--+--+"
    > say nsiter(This is a test,strlen(##))
    You say "4214"
    > say nsiter(This is a test,{strlen(##)})
    You say "4214"
    > say nsiter(lnum(10),mul(mul(##,##),10))
    You say "0104090160250360490640810"
    > say nsiter(lcon(me),[name(##)]..[money(##)])
    You say "test..1t1..1radio..1The Wizard's Pointy Hat..1"

& MUNGE()
  Function: munge([<obj>/]<attr>,<list 1>,<list 2>[[,<delim>][,<sep>]])
   
  This function takes two lists. It does *not* have to be of equal lengths.
  It passes the entirety of <list 1> to the user-defined function as %0. 
  The delimiter that it uses it passes to the user-defined function as %1.
  Then, this resulting list is matched with elements in <list 2>, and 
  the rearranged <list 2> is returned. This is useful for doing things 
  like sorting a list, and then returning the corresponding elements in 
  the other list. If a resulting element from the user-defined function 
  doesn't match an element in the original <list 1>, a corresponding element
  from <list 2> does not appear in the final result.  You may also specify
  an optional output <sep>erator and/or an optional <delim>iter for the
  lists.
   
  For example: Consider attribute PLACES, which contains "Fort Benden Ista",
  and another attribute DBREFS contains the dbrefs of the main JUMP_OK
  location of these areas, "#20 #9000 #5000".  We want to return a list of
  dbrefs, corresponding to the names of the places sorted alphabetically. The
  places sorted this way would be "Benden Fort Ista", so we want the final
  list to be "#9000 #20 #5000". The functions, using munge(), are simple:

& MUNGE2
  Examples:
    > &sort_alpha me=[sort(%0)]         (assume the default delimiter)
    > &sort_delim me=[sort(%0,,%1)]     (%1 is the delimiter given to munge)
    > say [munge(sort_alpha,v(places),v(dbrefs))]
    You say, "#9000 #20 #5000"
    > say [munge(sort_alpha,v(places),v(dbrefs),,-)]
    You say, "#9000-#20-#5000"
    > say [munge(sorta_delim,One Two Three|A B C|1 2 3,#20|#9000|#5000,|)]
    You say, "#5000|#9000|#20"
    > say [munge(sorta_delim,One Two Three|A B C|1 2 3,#20|#9000|#5000,|,%b)]
    You say, "#5000 #9000 #20"
    > say [munge(sorta_delim,One Two Three|A B C|1 2 3,#20|#9000|#5000,|,@)]
    You say, "#5000@#9000@#20"
  
  Note:  When using delimiters, the lists that you pass it can NOT be empty.
         Munge will not match up any empty lists sent to it.

& CITER()
  Function: citer(<list>, <eval>[, <delim>])
  
  <list> is a list of characters that you wish to iterate.  The list can
  be any regular character (including spaces).  <eval> is a string that is
  to be evaluated once for each character in <list>.  It returns a SPACE
  (or optional delimited) separated list of these evaluations.  The effect
  is similar to that of iter(), except it takes it as a character by 
  character basis instead of a word by word basis.  The special substitution
  of '##' is used for the current item of the list.  #@ is used for the
  positional match of that item in that list.  This is similar to 
  the explode function found on other mushes or in PHP.
  
  This function does not handle itext/inum/%i.  
   
  Examples:
    > say citer(boo!,##)
    You say "b o o !"
    > say citer(boo!,##-#@)
    You say "b-1 o-2 o-3 !-4"
    > say citer(testing,strlen(##))
    You say "1 1 1 1 1 1 1"
    > say citer(bob,## WHEE ##,@)
    You say "b WHEE b@o WHEE o@b WHEE b"
  
  See Also: iter(), nsiter(), list(), @dolist, creplace(), foreach()
  
& LOCATE()
  Function: locate(<looker>,<string>,<where>)
 
  The locate function is used to look for an object from the perspective of
  <looker> (You must own <looker>).  The database number of the item that
  is found is returned.  The <where> parameter specifies a list of places to
  look, from this list:
    a    - Look for absolute references (#<number>)
    c    - Look for exits carried by <looker> (and by <looker>'s parents).
    e    - Look for exits in <looker>'s location (and the location's parents).
    h    - Look for 'here', which matches <looker>'s location.
    i    - Look in <looker>'s inventory.
    m    - Look for 'me', which matches <looker>.
    n    - Look for <looker>'s neighbors (other objects in the same location).
    p    - Look for player names prefixed by a '*'
    *    - Look for everything in the above list.
  
{ 'help locate2' for more }
& locate2
  You may also specify qualifiers in <where> to help resolve possible
  ambiguities:
    E    - Prefer exits over other types.
    L    - Prefer unlocked exits over locked exits.
    P    - Prefer players over other types.
    R    - Prefer rooms over other types.
    T    - Prefer things over other types.
    V    - Report "Can't find..." and "Which one..." errors to <looker>.
 
  If nothing matches, the value #-1 is returned.  If more than one thing
  matches, but nothing matches exactly, the value #-2 is returned.  If more
  than one thing exactly matches, one is chosen at random.  If you specify
  more than one type preference (E, P, R, or T), then the last one entered
  is the one that is obeyed.  The default is for no type to be preferred.
 
  Examples:
    > I
    test1(#378)
    test(#376)
    You have 42463 clams.
  
{ 'help locate3' for more }
& locate3
    > look
    Nullspace(#250R)
    test1(#382)
    > say locate(me,test,i)
    You say "#376"
    > say locate(me,test,n)
    You say "#382"
    > say locate(me,test1,in)
    You say "#378"
    > say locate(me,test1,in)
    You say "#382"
    > say locate(me,tes,in)
    You say "#-2"
    > say locate(here,tes,*)
    You say "#382"
    > say locate(me,out,e)
    You say "#252"
    > say locate(me,here,*)
    You say "#250"
  
  See Also: num(), PARENT OBJECTS
  
& STRIP()
  Function: strip(<string1>,<string2> [,<type>])
  
  This function strips out every occurance of every character of <string2>
  from <string1> and returns <string1>.  The strip function is case
  sensitive.
  
  If <type> is specified as '1', then the functionality is reversed and
  it will only keep all characters in <string1> that exist in <string2>.
  
  Examples:
    > say strip(This is a test,is)
    You say "Th  a tet"
    > say strip(abcdefgABCDEFG,azGy!7$B)
    You say "bcdefgACDEF"
    > say strip(This is a test,is,1)
    You say "isiss"

& GARBLE()
  Function: garble(<str>,<value>[[,<sep>][,<fill>][,<type>][,<key>][,<eval>]])
  
  This function garbles the input from <str> and returns it garbled.  Each word
  has a 1 in <value> chance of being garbled.  Normal garbled strings have a 
  random character assigned unless you specify the filler character.  You may 
  specify a seperator other than space.  If you specify the <type> of '1', it 
  assumes the value is a percentile instead of fractional.  A <value> '0' with
  <type> '0' (1/0) returns nothing while <type> '1' (0%) returns the string.
  The key field allows the following bitwise values:
        1 - don't garble punctuation. (',!.?')
        2 - don't garble spaces.
        3 - (1 & 2) - don't garble punctuation or spaces.
        4 - takes 'eval' and parses it for each word in <str> (passed as %0)
        5-8 (same as 1-4 but return character count instead of word itself)
  
  Note: If you plan to <eval>, you need to escape out (or use lit()) on the
        argument as it passes the evaluated argument into the value.
   
  Examples:
    > say garble(this is a test!?,2)
    You say "this Z& a ^pN0w)"
    > say garble(this@is@a@test!?,2,@)
    You say "7u(9 is a %uNbn$"
    > say garble(this is a test!?,2,,-) (1 out of 2)
    You say "this is a ------"
    > say garble(this is a test!?,50,,-,1) (50 percent)
    You say "---- is a ------"
    > say garble(this is a test!?,50,,-,1,1) (50 percent, no garble punct.)
    You say "---- is a ----!?"
  
  See Also: strip(), edit(), editansi(), mask(), regedit()
  
& MASK()
  Function: mask(<value>,<value>[,<masktype>])
            mask(<value>,<value>,...,<value>,<masktype>)
  
  This function will apply a specified mask to a value.  This can be
  useful for bitwise anding/oring values together. (for those mathheads)
  The values available for masktype are:
     & -- Bitwise AND 
     | -- Bitwise OR
     ^ -- Bitwise XOR
     ~ -- Bitwise NAND (AND 1's compliment)
     1 -- Bitwise BNOT (1's Compliment)
     2 --              (2's Compliment)
  
  The default masktype is the bitwise AND (&) (but only with 2 arguments).
  
  Please note, if you use more than 2 values, you must specify the masktype,
  otherwise it'll assume the last argument is always the masktype.
  
  Examples:
    > say mask(3,4)
    You say "0"
    > say mask(3,4,|)
    You say "7"
    > say mask(3,4,^)
    You say "7"
  
  See Also: strip(), edit(), editansi(), garble(), regedit()
  
& ANDFLAG()
  Function: andflag(<target>,<flag1>[,<flag2>,...,<flagN>])
  
  This function checks if the target has ALL the specified flags.  You
  may also specify !FLAG to check if it does not have that specified flag.
  
  Examples:
    > say lflags(me)
    You say "PLAYER OPAQUE ANSI ANSICOLOR ALTQUOTA TERSE"
    > say andflag(me,ansi,ansicolor,!inherit)
    You say "1"
    > say andflag(me,ansi,terse,going)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: orflag(), hasflag(), lflags(), flags()
  
& ANDFLAGS()
  Function: andflags(<target>,<flag-list>)
  
  This function checks if the target has ALL the specified flags.  You
  may also specify !<letter> to check if it does not have the specified
  flag.  Since the GUEST flag is the '!' character as well, if you wish
  to match against the guest flag, you just escape it out like '\\!'.
  
  RhostMUSH also has a high-order of flags.  These show up between []'s
  when you do a flags().  To check against these flags, you must proceed
  it with a '2'.  To return back to the normal-order of flags, proceed
  it with a '1' (default).  You must escape out the '1' and the '2' if
  you wish to specify the MARKER flags (1 and 2).  Ie: '\\1', '\\2'.
  
  Examples:
    > say flags(me)
    You say "PDcW[I]"
    > say andflags(me,PD!o)]
    You say "1"
    > say andflags(me,PI)]
    You say "0"
    > say andflags(me,P2I)]
    You say "1"
    > say andflags(me,P2I1c)]
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: andflag(), orflag(), orflags(), hasflag(), flags(), lflags()
  
& ORFLAG()
  Function: orflag(<target>,<flag1>[,<flag2>,...,<flagN>])
  
  This function checks if the target has ONE of the specified flags.
  
  Examples:
    > say lflags(me)
    You say "PLAYER OPAQUE ANSI ANSICOLOR ALTQUOTA TERSE"
    > say orflag(me,slave,fubar,dark,unf)
    You say "0"
    > say orflag(me,slave,fubar,dark,ansi)
    You say "1"
   
  See Also: andflag(), hasflag(), lflags(), flags()
  
& ORFLAGS()
  Function: orflags(<target>,<flag-list>)
  
  This function checks if the target has ANY of the specified flags.  You
  may also specify !<letter> to check if it does not have the specified
  flag.  Since the GUEST flag is the '!' character as well, if you wish
  to match against the guest flag, you just escape it out like '\\!'.
  
  RhostMUSH also has a high-order of flags.  These show up between []'s
  when you do a flags().  To check against these flags, you must proceed
  it with a '2'.  To return back to the normal-order of flags, proceed
  it with a '1' (default).  You must escape out the '1' and the '2' if
  you wish to specify the MARKER flags (1 and 2).  Ie: '\\1', '\\2'.
  
  Examples:
    > say flags(me)
    You say "PDc!W[I]"
    > say orflags(me,!)]
    You say "0"
    > say orflags(me,\\!)]
    You say "1"
    > say orflags(me,P2I)]
    You say "1"
    > say orflags(me,P2I1qZV)]
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: andflag(), andflags(), orflag(), hasflag(), flags(), lflags()
  
& ANDCHR()
  Function: andchr(<string>,<listofcharacters>)
  
  This function returns true(1) if the specified <string> contains
  at least one of every character in <listofcharacters>.  If one
  of the characters does not exist, it'll return false(0).
  
  Examples:
    > say andchr(wizards,zdi)
    You say "1"
    > say andchr(wizards,zdx)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: orchr(), xorchr(), notchr()
  
& ORCHR()
  Function: orchr(<string>,<listofcharacters>)
  
  This function returns true(1) if any one of the characters in
  <listofcharacters> exists in <string>.  It will return false(0)
  if none of the characters exist in <string>.
  
  Examples:
    > say orchr(wizards,ymqi)
    You say "1"
    > say orchr(wizards,pqe)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: andchr(), xorchr(), notchr()
  
& XORCHR()
  Function: xorchr(<string>,<listofcharacters>)
  
  This function returns true(1) if only ONE of the characters in
  <listofcharacters> exists in <string>.  It will return false(0)
  under every other situation.
  
  Examples:
    > say xorchr(wizards,qim)
    You say "1"
    > say xorchr(wizards,qmp)
    You say "0"
    > say xorchr(wizards,izdw)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: andchr(), orchr(), notchr()
  
& NOTCHR()
  Function: notchr(<string>,<listofcharacters>)
  
  This function returns true(1) if NONE of the characters in
  <listofcharacters> exists in <string>.  It will return false(0)
  if any of the characters exist in <string>.
  
  Examples:
    > say notchr(wizards,qim)
    You say "0"
    > say notchr(wizards,qmp)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: andchr(), orchr(), xorchr()
  
& EDIT()
  Function: edit(<string>, <from>, <to> [[,<type>] [,<strict>]])
 
  This function edits <string>, replacing all occurrences of the substring
  <from> with the string <to>.  If <from> is '$', then <to> is appended to
  <string>, while if <from> is '^', then it is prepended.
  
  <type> has the following values that are allowed:
    1 - enable single edit (where it edits the first match no sequent matches)
  
  <strict> has the following values that are allowed:
    1 - strict mode will keep ansi alignment to original strings values.
    2 - raw mode will allow you to edit ansi markup in a string.
  
  Note: option 2 (raw mode) was the original method ansi worked.
   
  Examples:
    > say edit(This is a test,is,x)   
    You say "Thx x a test"
    > say edit(Atlantic,^,Trans)
    You say "TransAtlantic"
  
  See Also: @edit, editansi(), strip(), garble(), pedit(), chomp(), regedit()
  
& EDITANSI()
  Function: editansi(<string>, <search>, <replace> [,<search>, <replace>,...])
  
  This function will take a string, and replace all searched for ansi codes
  and replace them with the specified replaced ansi codes.  You may specify
  more than one search/replace segment for ansi codes, but they must always
  be in a paired set.
  
  The following logic works for the search and replace in order of priority:
    1.  If <search> is just ansi-normal (n), then it assumes you want an
        exact match on any character that has no previous encoding, and will
        replace with <replace> ALL encoding specified.
    2.  If <search> is an exact match, it substitutes <replace> overwriting
        all previous encoding.
    3.  If <search> is a FG color match only, it substitutes <replace> FG
        color and anything else in replacement encoding.
    4.  If <search> is a BG color match only, it substitutes <replace> BG
        color and anything else in replacement encoding.
    5.  If <search> is a special encoding (flash, normal, etc) it will
        replace anything in replacement encoding.
    6.  Specifying 'n' for any special encoding replacement will nullify 
        the special but will NOT nullify the color.  
    7.  Specifying 'n' for any color encoding replacement will nullify
        the color encoding but will NOT nullify the special encoding.
  
  The following ansi exclusions are allowed for search and replaces.
    H - anything NOT set hilite.
    I - anything NOT set inverse.
    U - anything NOT set underscore.
    F - anything NOT set flash.
    N - anything NOT using ansi colors.
  
  If these are specified in replace, it will strip those specified ansi
  special encodings. 
    
  Examples:
    > say editansi([ansi(hb,abc,n,def)],n,hr)
    You say "abcdef"    (abc is hilight blue, def is hilight red)
    > say editansi([ansi(hb,abc,n,def)],hb,hy)
    You say "abcdef"    (abc is hilight yellow, def is non-ansified)
    > say editansi([ansi(hb,abc,hg,xyz,n,def)],hb,y,hg,b)
    You say "abcxyzdef" (abc is yellow, xyz is blue, def is non-ansi)
  
  See Also: accents(), edit(), regedit(), pemit(), @edit

& PEDIT()
  Function: pedit(<string>,<from>,<to>[,<from>,<to>,...])
 
  This function edits <string>, replacing all occurrences of the substring
  <from> with the string <to>.  If <from> is '$', then <to> is appended to
  <string>, while if <from> is '^', then it is prepended.  You may specify
  multiple 'froms' and 'to's in the string.  This is to mimic Penn's
  edit() functionality.
 
  Examples:
    > say pedit(This is a test,is,x)   
    You say "Thx x a test"
    > say pedit(Atlantic,^,Trans)
    You say "TransAtlantic"
    > say pedit(This is a test,is,was,was,were)
    You say "This were a test"
  
  See Also: @edit, strip(), garble(), edit(), editansi(), chomp(), regedit()
  
& STREQ()
  Function: streq(<string1>,<string2>)
  
  This function takes two strings and compares them.  If they match, it
  returns a '1', if not, it returns a '0'.  This is not case sensitive.
  
  Examples:
    > streq(this is a test,THIS is A TesT)
    You say "1"
    > streq(this is a test,this is a test?)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: comp(), ncomp(), match(), member()
  
& WHILE()
  while([<uobj>/]<uattr>,[<cobj>/]<cattr>,<list>,<str>[,<delim>[,<output d>]])
  
  This function evaluates the elements of <list>, until a termination
  condition is reached or the end of the list is reached.
  
  [<uobj>/]<uattr> is an attribute or object/attribute pair, like the first
  argument of map(). The <list> is passed to that function element-by-element
  (based on the input <delim> delimiter) as %0, just as if map() were being
  called, and the output is returned <output d>-delimited, again just as if
  map() were being called.
  
  However, for each element, after that evaluation is done, a second
  evaluation is done, to check a "termination value". [<cobj>/]<cattr>
  is an attribute or object/attribute pair, again like map(), and the
  same list elements are passed to that function as %0. However, the
  result of this evaluation is not kept; instead, it is compared to
  <str>, and if it matches exactly (case-sensitive, no wildcards),
  the no further elements of the list are processed.
  
{ Continued in 'help while2'. }
  
& WHILE2
  while([<uobj>/]<uattr>,[<cobj>/]<cattr>,<list>,<str>[,<delim>[,<output d>]])
  
                              (CONTINUED)
  
  If the contents of [<uobj>/]<uattr> and [<cobj>/]<cattr> are the
  same, the element is not evaluated twice; the result of the first
  evaluation is directly compared against <str>. (Note that the
  two object/attributes don't have to be the same -- just their
  contents need to be the same, since this function treats the
  pair like map(), not like u().)
  
  Examples:
    > &EVAL_FN me = [reverse(%0)]
    > &COND_FN me = [strlen(%0)]
    > say [while(EVAL_FN,COND_FN,foo bar meep flibble baz,4)]
    You say "oof rab peem"
    > SAY [while(EVAL_FN,COND_FN,foo|bar|meep|flibble|baz,4,|,-)]
    You say "oof-rab-peem"
  
  This function provided for TinyMUSH 3.0 compatibility.
  
  See Also: map(), step(), foreach(), iter()
  
& STR()
  Function: str(<string>,<match>)
  
  The str function works very similar to after() and very much like the
  C function strstr.  This takes the string starting at the first match
  and returns that string to the end of that string.  This function runs
  faster than the after() function.
  
  Examples:
    > say str(This is a test,his)
    You say "his is a test"
  
  See Also: nostr(), before(), after()
  
& NOSTR()
  Function: nostr(<string>,<match>)
  
  The nostr function works exactly opposite of the str() function.
  It will return a string up to the specified match.   In this instance
  it works just like before(), but is faster slightly than the before()
  function.
  
  Examples:
    > say nostr(This is a test,tes)
    You say "This is a "
  
  See Also: str(), before(), after()
  
& OBJEVAL()
  Function: objeval(<thing>,<function> [,<permission override>])
  
  The objeval function evaluates the target function according to the 
  permissions of the thing that is specified.  If you normally do not
  have those permissions, it uses your permissions instead.  This is 
  useful when you need to parse arguments under a different permission 
  level than the one you currently at.
  
  Permission override, if specified to '1' by a wizard enactor, will
  override the NO_CODE flag on the target and still execute any code
  of that person.  This is ignored for any inactor not a wizard.
   
  Examples:
    > (Let's assume #4523 is an object owned by a normal player)
    > say objeval(#4523,lwho())
    You say "#5 #6 #8" (assuming those are the dbrief#'s of connected players)
  
  This evaluates the lwho() function at citizen level even if you are
  a wizard.
  
  See Also: u(), u2(), get_eval(), objeval(), ueval() 
  
& ZFUNEVAL()
  Function: zfuneval([<zone>/]<attr>/permission[,<arg>],...)
  
  The zfuneval function evaluates an attribute, either from the object 
  performing the function or from another zone you control, passing in 
  arguments and returning the result.  In this way it works just like 'zfun()',
  except you pass in a permission to specify what permission level you wish to
  use for evaluation.  It assumes the enactor (owner) of the function always 
  succeeds.  When evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original 
  enactor and not the 'calling' object, and 'me' refers to the object that 
  supplied the attribute.  For more detail on functionality, look at ZFUN().
 
  The available permission levels are CIT[IZEN], GUILD[MASTER], ARCH[ITECT],
  COUN[CILOR], ROY[ALTY], IMM[ORTAL].  You must have the permissions of the
  given level in order to use it else it defaults to your permission level.
  The permission must be included for the function to work.
  
  Examples:
    > @set me=royalty (let's assume you're a wizard)
    > @va #2=[num(*Miriar)] (the ghod character - #1) (#2 a zone you control)
    > say zfuneval(va/royalty)
    You say "#1"
    > say zfuneval(va/citizen)
    You say "#-1"
  
  See Also: zfun(), zfun2(), objeval(), zfunlocal(), zfun2local()
  
& UEVAL()
  Function: ueval([<obj>/]<attr>/permission[,<arg>],...)
  
  The ueval function evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing
  the function or from another object you own, passing in arguments and
  returning the result.  In this way it works just like 'u()', except you 
  pass in a permission to specify what permission level you wish to use for
  evaluation.  It assumes the enactor (owner) of the function always succeeds.
  When evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and
  not the 'calling' object, and 'me' refers to the object that supplied the
  attribute.  For more detail on functionality, look at U().
 
  The available permission levels are CIT[IZEN], GUILD[MASTER], ARCH[ITECT],
  COUN[CILOR], ROY[ALTY], IMM[ORTAL].  You must have the permissions of the
  given level in order to use it else it defaults to your permission level.
  The permission must be included for the function to work.
  
  Examples:
    > @set me=royalty (let's assume you're a wizard)
    > @va me=[num(*Miriar)] (the ghod character - #1)
    > say ueval(va/royalty)
    You say "#1"
    > say ueval(va/citizen)
    You say "#-1"
  
  See Also: u(), u2(), objeval(), ulocal(), u2local(), streval()
  
& U()
  Function: u([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
 
  The u function evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the
  function or from another object you own, passing in arguments and returning
  the result.
  
  When evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and
  not the 'calling' object, and 'me' refers to the object that supplied the
  attribute.
  
  See '@list options' to see if this functionality switched with u2()'.
  This will be switched if 'u() TinyMUSH compatibility' is enabled.
   
  Examples:
    > @va me=Word is [extract(v(vb),add(%0,1),1)], arg2 is %1.
    > @vb me=This is a test of the u function.
    > say u(va,4,Testing 123)
    You say "Word is of, arg2 is Testing 123."
    > say u(va,7)
    You say "Word is function., arg2 is ."
    > say u(me/va,6,Foobar)
    You say "Word is u, arg2 is Foobar."

& STREVAL()
  Function: streval(<string>, <evaluation level> [,<arg>,<arg2>,...,<argN>])
  
  This function works similar to u() or eval() where it takes the <string>
  then evaluates it according to the permission of <evaluation level>.  You
  must be equal to or less than the bitlevel specified or it assumes your
  own level.  By default, none of the arguments passed will be evaluated.
  
  Evaluation Levels allowed:
      CIT[IZEN]     -- Mortal (bit level 1)
      GUILD[MASTER] -- Staff (bit level 2)
      ARCH[ITECT]   -- Staff (bit level 3)
      COUN[CILOR]   -- Staff (bit level 4)
      ROY[ALTY]     -- Staff (bit level 5) -- This is a full Wizard
      IMM[ORTAL]    -- Staff (bit level 6) -- This is essentially #1
      GOD           -- Staff (bit level 7) -- Can only be ran as #1
  
  Examples: (assuming your a full wizard (royalty))
    > say streval(My bitlevel: [bittype(me)],immortal)
    You say "5"                  (immortal is above your lvl, so ignores)
    > say streval(My bitlevel: [bittype(me)],councilor)
    You say "4"
    > say streval(My bitlevel: [bittype(me)] -- Arg %0,citizen,foo!)]
    You say "1 -- Arg foo!"
    > say streval(NoEval: %0 ... Eval: [s(%0)],citizen,[add(1,1)])
    You say "Noeval: [add(1,1)] ... Eval: 2"
    > say streval(Test: [s(%0)],citizen,[bittype(me)])
    You say "Test: 1"

& U2()
  Function: u2([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
  
  This is nearly exactly like the original u() function except it parses
  in an object-dependant way like the old mushes.  It works by evaluating
  the function(s) by the power of the owner of the item it's on, and not
  by the power of the enactor.  
  
  This command is also very handy to keep security.
  
  See '@list options' to see if this functionality switched with u2()'.
  This will be switched if 'u() TinyMUSH compatibility' is enabled.
   
  For examples or more information, look at u()
  
  See Also: u(), u2local(), u2ldefault(), @lfunction
  
& ZFUN2LOCAL()
  Function:  zfun2local([<zone>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
 
  The zfun2local() function is almost identical to zfun2() in function:  it
  evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the function,
  or another object that you control or has the same owner as you, passing
  in arguments and returning the result. When evaluating the fetched
  attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and not the 'calling' object;
  'me' refers to the object that supplied the attribute.
 
  However, unlike the zfun2() function, the global registers r(0) through r(9)
  (%q0 - %q9) are preserved in their initial state. This means that functions
  "below" the level of the zfun2() can reset global registers for temporary
  calculations, without needing to worry about "clobbering" the original
  values.
 
  This makes zfun2local() particularly useful for global or shared code which
  calls arbitrary zfun2() functions, where global register values need to be
  preserved from accidental user clobbering.
 
{ See "help zfun2local2" for examples. }
 
& ZFUN2LOCAL2
  Example of zfun2local():
    > @zone #2=#0
    > &FRUIT #2=apples bananas oranges pears
    > &SUB-FUNCTION #2=[setq(0,v(FRUIT))][extract(%q0,match(%q0,%0),1)]
    > &TOP-FUNCTION #2=[setq(0,are delicious!)][zfun2local(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say zfun2(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas are delicious!"
 
  If SUB-FUNCTION had been called with zfun2() instead of zfun2local():
    > &TOP-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,are delicious!)][zfun2(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say zfun2(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas apples bananas oranges pears"
 
  In this second example, in SUB-FUNCTION, %q0 was set to "apples bananas
  oranges pears", so that when the zfun2() "returned" and TOP-FUNCTION 
  evaluated %q0, this is what was printed. In the first example, zfun2local() 
  reset the value of %q0 to its original "are delicious!"

& U2LOCAL()
  Function:  u2local([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)

& ULOCAL()
  Function:  ulocal([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
   
  The ulocal() function is almost identical to u() in function:  it
  evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the function,
  or another object that you control or has the same owner as you, passing
  in arguments and returning the result. When evaluating the fetched
  attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and not the 'calling' object;

             @lfunction
  
& PRIVATIZE()
  Function: privatize(<value>)
  
  This function takes two values.  1 to enable or 0 to disable (default).
  When enabled, any function call that is using localization for registers,
  such as localize(), ulocal(), ueval(), uzfun(), etc, will be initialized
  to a null (empty string) instead of housing the contents that was passed
  to it (which is the default).  Keep in mind, this only initializes the
  localized values, and once the localization is finished, the values are
  returned to their previous value, as how localization is intended.
  
  The Values allowed are:
    1 - Toggle on the feature to initialize to null all registers (%q0-z)
        that are used in localized functions (localize(), ulocal(), etc)
    0 - Toggle off the feature to initialize to null registers (default).
  
  Example:
    > @va me=(before R0: [r(0)])[setq(0,internal)] --My R0:[r(0)]--
    Set.
    > say [setq(0,external)][r(0)][u(va)][r(0)]
    You say "external--(before R0: external) My R0:internal--internal"
    > say [setq(0,external)][r(0)][localize(u(va))][r(0)]
    You say "external--(before R0: external) My R0:internal--external"
    > say [privatize(1)][setq(0,external)][r(0)][localize(u(va))][r(0)]
    You say "external--(before R0: ) My R0:internal--external"
  
  See Also: pushregs(), ulocal(), zfunlocal(), eval(), localize(), @lfunction

& LOCALIZE()
  Function: localize(<string> [,<register-list>, [<key>]])
  
  This function will evaluate <string> while preserving all setq() registers
  outside of the function.  This is handy for calling global code or other
  functionality without it effecting your own functions and commands.
  
  You may specify a register list if you want only specific registers to be
  localized.  Otherwise, by default it assumes all registers.
  
  Accepted register values are:
    0-9 -- Standard Q registers.
    a-z -- Extended Q registers.
  
  If the <key> is set to 1, the behavior is reversed and any register that
  you specify will be omitted from localization.  The default is '0'.
   
  Example:
    > @va me=[setq(0,internal)]--My R0:[r(0)]--
    Set.
    > say [setq(0,external)][r(0)][u(va)][r(0)]
    You say "external--My R0:internal--internal"
    > say [setq(0,external)][r(0)][localize(u(va))][r(0)]
    You say "external--My R0:internal--external"
    > say [setq(0,external)][r(0)][localize(u(va),12345)][r(0)]
    You say "external--My R0:internal--internal"
  
  Note: In the last example, we allowed '12345' to be localized, but not '0'.
  
  See Also: pushregs(), ulocal(), zfunlocal(), eval(), privatize(), @lfunction
  
& LOCALFUNC()
  Function: localfunc(<function-name>, <args>...)
  
  The localfunc() function is used to call customized functions that are
  server specific and allows a wrapper so that new functions might be added
  without having to modify more than a single file of the source.
  
  Example:
    > localfunc(test,This is a test)
    You say "This was a test. Function: 'test' First Arg: 'This is a test'"
  
  See Also: strfunc(), @lfunction
  
& LAVG()
  Function: lavg(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function takes a list of numbers and takes the average of all the 
  numbers added together.  It may take an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lavg(2 4 6 8 10)
    You say "6"
    > say lavg(2@4@6@8@10,@)
    You say "6"
  
  See Also: lsub(), ldiv(), lmul(), lmax(), lmin(), ladd()
  
& LSUB()
  Function: lsub(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function takes the first number in the list, and subtracts from that
  all the other numbers in the list.  It may take an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lsub(10 2 3 1)
    You say "4"
    > say lsub(10@2@3@1,@)
    You say "4"
  
  See Also: lavg(), ldiv(), lmul(), lmax(), lmin(), ladd()
  
& LMUL()
  Function: lmul(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function takes the list of numbers and multiplies them all together
  and returns the result.  It may take an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lmul(2 2 2 2)
    You say "16"
    > say lmul(2@2@2@2,@)
    You say "16"
  
  See Also: lavg(), ldiv(), lsub(), lmax(), lmin(), ladd()
  
& LDIV()
  Function: ldiv(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function takes the first number in the list, and divides from that
  all the other numbers in the list.  All zeros are ignored.  It may
  take an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say ldiv(20 2 0 0 0 0 2)
    You say "5"
    > say ldiv(20@2@0@0@0@0@2,@)
    You say "5"
  
  See Also: lavg(), lmul(), lsub(), lmax(), lmin(), ladd()
  
& LASTCREATE()
  Function: lastcreate(<target>,<type>)
  
  This function will return the dbref# of the last <type> that was created
  by the target.  If the type was not created by the target, it will return
  a '#-1'.  Possible types are:
                r - rooms
                t - things (objects)
                e - exits
                p - players
  
  If an invalid type is given, it will return '#-1'.
  
  Example:
    > say lastcreate(me,t)
    You say "#-1"
    > @create MyObject
    MyObject created as object #1369
    > say lastcreate(me,t)
    You say "#1369"
  
  See Also: @create, @dig, @open, @clone
  
& LMAX()
  Function: lmax(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function returns the maximum value from the list.  You may specify an
  optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lmax(1 10 2 4 6)
    You say "10"
    > say lmax(1@10@2@4@6,@)
    You say "10"
  
  See Also: lmin(), max(), min(), alphamax(), alphamin()
  
& LMIN()
  Function: lmin(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function returns the minimum value from the list.  You may specify an
  optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lmax(1 10 2 -4 6)
    You say "-4"
    > say lmax(1@10@2@-4@6,@)
    You say "-4"
  
  See Also: lmax(), max(), min(), alphamax(), alphamin()
    
& LOR()
  Function: lor(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function goes through the list and or's the values together.  At the
  first '1' it finds, it exits the function and returns a '1'.  You may
  specify an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lor(0 1 1)
    You say "1"
    > say lor(0@1@1,@)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: land(), lnor(), lxor(), lxnor()
  
& LNOR()
  Function: lnor(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  Takes the list, and returns true(1) if values are false(0) or 
  false(0) if values are true(1).  You may specify an optional
  delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lnor(0 0)
    You say "1"
    > say lnor(0@0,@)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: land(), lnor(), lxor(), lxnor()
  
& LAND()
  Function: land(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function goes through the list of numbers and and's the numbers
  together.  If a '0' is found in the list, it ends evaluation there
  and returns '0'.  You may specify an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say land(0 1 1)
    You say "0"
    > say land(0@1@1,@)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lor(), lnor(), lxor(), lxnor()
  
& LXOR()
  Function: lxor(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns 1 if an odd number of them are
  equivalent to true(1).  You may specify an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lxor(0 1 0 1 0 1)
    You say "1"
    > say lxor(0@1@0@1@0@1,@)
    You say "1"
     
  See Also: lor(), lnor(), land(), lxnor()
  
& LXNOR()
  Function: lxnor(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
   
  Takes two or more booleans, and returns true(1) if both values are
  true(1) or false(0) and returns false(0) if any one value is
  false(0) but the other(s) are true(1).  You may specify an optional
  delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say lxnor(1 1 1 1 1 0)
    You say "0"
    > say lxnor(1@1@1@1@1@0,@)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: lor(), lnor(), land(), lxor()
  
& LADD()
  Function: ladd(<list of numbers>[,<delim>])
  
  This function takes a list of numbers and adds them all together and returns
  the result.  It may take an optional delimiter.
  
  Example:
    > say ladd(1 1 1 1 1)
    You say "5"
    > say ladd(1@1@1@1@1,@)
    You say "5"
  
  See Also: lsub(), ldiv(), lmul(), lmax(), lmin(), lavg()
  
& @@()
  Function: @@(<string>)
  
  This function will eat all output from <string>.  This is handy if you want
  to place comments within functions.  Anything within @@() is NOT evaluated.
  
  Example:
    > say [@@(this is a test[setq(0,test)])]- [r(0)]
    You say "- "
  
  See Also: localize(), eval(), null(), privatize()
  
& NULL()
  Function: null(<string>)
  
  This function will eat all output from <string>.  This is handy if you want
  to evaluate side-effects or other functionality without having any output.
  Be warned, this function DOES evaluate as stated above.
  
  Example:
    > say [null(this is a test[setq(0,test)])]- [r(0)]
    You say "- test"
  
  See Also: localize(), eval(), @@(), privatize()
  
& STEP()
  Function: step([<obj>/]<attr>,<list>,<step size>[,<delim>[,<output delim>]])
  
  This function takes elements of <list>, <step size> elements at a time,
  and passes them to the function defined by <attr>, as %0, %1, %2,
  etc. The number of elements in the list does not need to be evenly
  divisible by the step size. If no delimiters are provided, a space is
  used as the delimiter. The step size must be at least 1, and no greater
  than 30. Calling this function with a step size of 1 is equivalent to
  using map().  Anything over argument 9 (%9) can be called with v().  Such
  as v(10), v(20), and so forth.
  
  Example:
    > &print_line me = %r%0 -- %1 -- %2
    Set.
    > say [step(print_line,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8,3)]
    You say "
    1 -- 2 -- 3
    4 -- 5 -- 6
    7 -- 8 --"
  
  This function provided for compatibility with TinyMUSH 3.0
  
  See Also: while(), map(), munge(), iter(), columns()
  
& ZONECMDCHK
  Toggle: ZONECMDCHK(k)
  
  This toggle, when set, will enable the target to search for $commands
  from a zone as if it were a parent.  This is only useful on commands
  and players.  This toggle is meaningless on rooms (as rooms are already
  searched).
  

& NOISY
  Toggle: NOISY(N)
  
  This toggle, when set, will set the target's 'set/clear' mode for
  setting/clearing attributes and flags to verbose mode.
  
& KEEPFLAGS()
  Function: keepflags(<list>, [&|]<flag(s)> [,<delim>[,<output delim>]])
  
  The keepflags function keeps all dbref#'s in the given list that contains
  the flags specified.  You must use one of the operators for flag checks:
     & - match ALL flags for each dbref#.
     | - match ANY of the flags for each dbref#.
  
  This function returns the list of dbref#'s that correctly match up the
  flags you specified.
  
  Examples: (#1 is a wizard, nothing else is)
    > say keepflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,&W)
    You say "#1"
    > say keepflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,&Ws)
    You say ""
    > say keepflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,|Ws)
    You say "#1"
  
  Note: You may specify 'P' for players, 'R', for rooms, and 'E' for exits
        as valid flag checks.
  
  See Also: remflags(), remtype(), keeptype()

& REMFLAGS()
  Function: remflags(<list>, [&|]<flag(s)> [,<delim>[,<output delim>]])
  
  The remflags function removes all dbref#'s in the given list that contains
  the flags specified.  You must use one of the operators for flag checks:
     & - match ALL flags for each dbref#.
     | - match ANY of the flags for each dbref#.
  
  This function returns the list of dbref#'s that correctly match up the
  flags you specified.
  
  Examples: (#1 is a wizard, nothing else is)
    > say remflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,&W)
    You say "#2 #3 #4"
    > say remflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,&Ws)
    You say "#1 #2 #3 #4"
    > say remflags(#1 #2 #3 #4,|Ws)
    You say "#2 #3 #4"
  
  Note: You may specify 'P' for players, 'R', for rooms, and 'E' for exits
        as valid flag checks.
  
  See Also: keepflags(), remtype(), keeptype()

& KEEPTYPE()
  Function: keeptype(<string>,<type(s)>[,<delim>[,<output delim>]])
 
  The keeptype function KEEPS all types of 'type' from the string 'string'.
  The different types are standard MUSH object types:
      PLAYER - specifying robots and players
      THING  - specifying objects
      ROOM   - specifying rooms
      EXIT   - specifying exits
      OTHER  - specifying anything not fitting a MUSH 'type'.
  
  You may specify optional seperators and output seperators.   You may specify
  more than one type at once.
  
  Examples: (#0 is a room, #1 #55 and #584 are players, #-1 is invalid (other))
    > say keeptype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,player)
    You say "#1 #55 #584"
    > say keeptype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,exit)
    You say ""
    > say keeptype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,other)
    You say "#-1"
    > say keeptype(#0@#1@#55@#584@#-1,player,@,|)
    You say "#1|#55|#584"
    > say keeptype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,player other)
    You say "#1 #55 #584 #-1"
  
  See Also: delete(), remove(), ldelete(), replace(), remtype()
  
& REMTYPE()
  Function: remtype(<string>,<type(s)>[,<delim>[,<output delim>]])
 
  The remtype function removes all types of 'type' from the string 'string'.
  The different types are standard MUSH object types:
      PLAYER - specifying robots and players
      THING  - specifying objects
      ROOM   - specifying rooms
      EXIT   - specifying exits
      OTHER  - specifying anything not fitting a MUSH 'type'.
  
  You may specify optional seperators and output seperators.   You may specify
  more than one type at once.
  
  Examples: (#0 is a room, #1 #55 and #584 are players, #-1 is invalid (other))
    > say remtype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,player)
    You say "#0 #-1"
    > say remtype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,exit)
    You say "#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1"
    > say remtype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,other)
    You say "#0 #1 #55 #584"
    > say remtype(#0@#1@#55@#584@#-1,other,@,|)
    You say "#0|#1|#55|#584"
    > say remtype(#0 #1 #55 #584 #-1,player other)
    You say "#0"

& SWITCH()
  Function: switch(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>]...[,<dflt>])
   
  The switch function compares <str> against <pat1>, <pat2>, etc (allowing *
  to match any number of characters and ? to match any 1 character), and
  returns the corresponding <resN> parameter for the first <patN> pattern
  that matches.  If none match, then the default result <dflt> is returned.
   
  Example:
    > say switch(c,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "C"
    > say switch(f,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "E"
    > say switch(cab,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "A"
    > say switch(f,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D)  
    You say ""
  
  If configured, you may use #$ as a substition.   #$ is substituted with 
  the value of <string>. In this way, the commands in <res11>..<dflt> 
  have a short-hand way of getting at the matched value. 
  
  Please check @list options if this has been enabled. 
  
  See Also: @switch, match(), case(), ifelse(), switchall()
  
& SWITCHALL()
  Function: switchall(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>]...[,<dflt>])
   
  The switchall function compares <str> against <pat1>, <pat2>, etc (allowing *
  to match any number of characters and ? to match any 1 character), and
  returns all corresponding <resN> parameters for all <patN> patterns
  that matches.  If none match, then the default result <dflt> is returned.
 
  Example:
    > say switchall(c,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "C"
    > say switchall(f,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "E"
    > say switchall(cab,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D,E)
    You say "ABC"
    > say switchall(f,*a*,A,*b*,B,*c*,C,*d*,D)  
    You say ""
  
  If configured, you may use #$ as a substition.   #$ is substituted with 
  the value of <string>. In this way, the commands in <res11>..<dflt> 
  have a short-hand way of getting at the matched value. 
  
  Please check @list options if this has been enabled.

& RESWITCH()
  Function: reswitch(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  Function: reswitchall(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  Function: reswitchi(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  Function: reswitchalli(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  
  This function is just like switch(), except they compare <string> against
  a series of regular expressions, not wildcard patterns.  This function
  is case-sensitive.
  
  Example:
    > say reswitch(xxcxxxxxx,.*a.*,A,.*b.*,B,.*c.*,C,.*d.*,D,E)
    You say "C"
  
  See Also: switch(), reswitchi(), reswitchall(), reswitchalli(), regexps

& RESWITCHI()
  Function: reswitchi(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  
  This function is just like switch(), except they compare <string> against
  a series of regular expressions, not wildcard patterns.  This function
  is case-insensitive.
  
  Example:
    > say reswitchi(c,.a.,A,.b.,B,.c.,C,.d.,D,E)
    You say "C"
  
  See Also: switch(), reswitch(), reswitchall(), reswitchalli(), regexps

& RESWITCHALL()
  Function: reswitchall(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  
  This function is just like switch(), except they compare <string> against
  a series of regular expressions, not wildcard patterns.  This function
  is case-sensitive.  This function will return all matches.
  
  Example:
    > say reswitchall(c,.a.,A,.b.,B,.c.,C,.d.,D,E)
    You say "C"
  
  See Also: switch(), reswitchi(), reswitch(), reswitchalli(), regexps

& RESWITCHALLI()
  Function: reswitchalli(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>,[<patN>,<resN>],...[,<dflt>]])
  
  This function is just like switch(), except they compare <string> against
  a series of regular expressions, not wildcard patterns.  This function
  is case-insensitive.  This function will return all matches.
  
  Example:
    > say switchall(c,.a.,A,.b.,B,.c.,C,.d.,D,E)
    You say "C"
  
  See Also: switch(), reswitchi(), reswitchi(), reswitchall(), regexps

& ifelse()
  Function: ifelse(<expression>,<true string>[,<false string>])
 
  This function returns <true string> if <expression> is true (not 0), 
  <false string> otherwise. Much more efficient than an equivalent
  switch(). To check if a string contains text or not, use strlen() within
  the test case.  The false string is optional and if nothing is specified, 
  it will return an empty string if a false match is met.  This will 
  effectively mimic the if() function found on other servers.
  
  Example:
    > say ifelse(v(test),Test exists!,Test doesn't exist.)
    You say "Test doesn't exist."
    > say ifelse(strlen(v(test)),Test exits!,Test doesn't exist.)
    You say "Test exists!"
    > say ifelse(gt(1,0),This is true!)
    You say "This is true!"
    > say ifelse(gt(0,1),This is true!)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: switch(), case(), @switch
 
& hastype()
  Function: hastype(<object>, <type>)
  
  Returns 1 if the object is of the named type, otherwise 0.
  Valid types are: ROOM, EXIT, PLAYER, THING.
  If an invalid type is given, #-1 is returned.
  
  Examples:
    > say hastype(me,PLAYER)
    You say "1"
    > say hastype(me,THING)
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: type(), hasflag()
  
& hasattr()
  Function: hasattr(<object>/<attribute name>)
            hasattr(<object>,<attribute name>)
   
  Returns 1 if the object has the named attribute, and 0 if it does
  not. If the object does not exist or the player does not have the
  ability to examine the object, #-1 will be returned.
 
  Hasattr() doesn't check for attributes inherited from parent
  objects. Use hasattrp() for that.
  
  Examples:
    > say hasattr(me/sex)
    You say "1"
    > say hasattr(me/adsadf)
    You say "0"
    > say hasattr(me,sex)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: hasattrp(), hasflag()
  
& hasattrp()
  Function: hasattrp(<object>/<attribute name>)
            hasattrp(<object>,<attribute name>)
   
  Returns 1 if any of it's parents has the named attribute,
  and 0 if it does not. If the object does not exist or the player
  does not have the ability to examine the object, #-1 will be returned.
 
  Use hasattr() to check for attributes without checking parents.
  If the config option hasattrp_compat is set, it will check the target
  object for the attribute as well.
  
  Examples:
    > say hasattrp(me/desc)
    You say "1"
    > say hasattrp(me,desc)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: hasattr(), hasflag()
  
& shl()
  Function: shl(<number or string>,<count>)
  
  Performs a leftwards bit-shift on <number>, shifting it <count> times.
  This is equivalent to mul(<number>,pow(2,<count>), but much faster.
  This function also shifts left a given string <count> number
  of characters.
  
  Examples:
    > say shl(1,4)
    You say "16"
    > say shl(weird!!!,3)
    You say "rd!!!"
  
  See Also: shr(), rotl(), rotr()
  
& shr()
  Function: shr(<number or string>,<count>)
  
  Performs a rightwards bit-shift on <number>, shifting it <count> times.
  This is equivalent to div(<number>,pow(2,<count>), but much faster.
  Function: case(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>]...[,<dflt>]).  This function also
  shifts right a given string <count> number of characters.
  
  Examples:
    > say shr(16,3)
    You say "2"
    > say shr(weird!!!,4)
    You say "weir"
  
  See Also: shl(), rotl(), rotr()
  
& rotl()
  Function: rotl(<string>,<count>)
  
  This function rotates a given string <count> number of characters to the
  left and wraps around the text.
  
  Examples:
    > say rotl(this is a test,5)
    You say "is a testthis "
    > say rotl(weird,2)
    You say "irdwe"
  
  See Also: shl(), shr(), rotr()
  
& rotr()
  Function: rotl(<string>,<count>)
  
  This function rotates a given string <count> number of characters to the
  right and wraps around the text.
  
  Examples:
    > say rotr(this is a test,5)
    You say " testthis is a"
    > say rotr(weird,2)
    You say "rdwei"
  
  See Also: shl(), shr(), rotl()
  
& caseall()
  Function: caseall(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>]...[,<dflt>])
  caseall() is like switchall() but does not do wildcard matching 
  (i.e., using *).  In cases where wildcards are not needed, it performs 
  marginally faster.  This function is also case sensitive.
   
  Example:
    > say caseall(c,a,A,b,B,c,C,d,D,c,X,E)
    You say "CX"
    > say caseall(f,a,A,b,B,c,C,d,D,E)
    You say "E"
  
  See Also: @switch, match(), ifelse(), switch(), switchall()
  
& case()
  Function: case(<str>[,<pat1>,<res1>]...[,<dflt>])
  case() is like switch() but does not do wildcard matching (i.e., using *).
  In cases where wildcards are not needed, it performs marginally faster.
  This function is also case sensitive.
   
  Example:
    > say case(c,a,A,b,B,c,C,d,D,E)
    You say "C"
    > say case(f,a,A,b,B,c,C,d,D,E)
    You say "E"
  
  See Also: @switch, match(), ifelse(), switch()
  
& SPEAK()
  See 'help parsestr()'
  
& SPACE()
  Function: space(<count>)
 
  Returns the number of indicated spaces.  If <count> is missing, negative,
  or cannot be converted to a number, one space is returned.  This function
  is useful when you want to pass a single space (or more than one) as a
  function to an argument, because normally leading and trailing spaces are
  stripped from function arguments.
 
  Examples:
    > say space(4)
    You say "    "
    > say edit(Foo bar bletch, space(), X)
    You say "FooXbarXbletch"
  
  See Also: repeat(), SUBSTITUTIONS
  
& SPELLNUM()
  Function: spellnum(<number>)
  
  This function, when fed a number (decimal or floating point) will return
  the long name of the number (or in other wordes, the number in words).
  
  Examples:
    > say spellnum(10)
    You say "ten"
    > say spellnum(1010)
    You say "one thousand ten"
  
  See Also: strmath()

& LPARENT()
  Function: lparent(<obj>)
  
  Returns all the parents of <obj>.  Returns #-1 if <obj> cannot be found
  or has no parent or if you do not own and/or control <obj>
  
  Example:
    > say lparent(me)
    You say "#-1"
    > @parent #4=#5
    Parent set.
    > @parent #5=#6
    Parent set.
    > say lparent(#4)
    You say "#5 #6"
  
  See Also: parent(), children()
  
& ROMAN()
  Function: roman(<number>)
  
  This function converts the given number to the Roman Numeral equivelant.
  It will convert any number between 1 and 3999999.  As the normal
  overslash on the higher roman numerials are not easilly supported in a text
  environment, the higher roman numerals will be displayed as lower case.
  The following roman numeral mapping exists:
      I - 1          L - 50           v - 5000        c - 100000
      V - 5          C - 100          x - 10000       m - 1000000
      X - 10         M - 1000         l - 50000
  
  Examples:
    > say roman(1999)
    You say "MCMXCIX"
    > say roman(777777)
    You say "dcclxxvMMDCCLXXVII"
  
  See Also: pack()

& PACK()
  Function: pack(<number>[[,<radix>][,<penn compat flag>]])
   
  Returns the equivalent of the given number using the specified base.
  The default radix is 64. Bases greater than 10 will be more compact
  than the original number. Bases less than 10 will be more expanded.
   
  The inverse function of pack is unpack. pack and unpack are designed
  to support the base-36 radix conversion used in Myrddin's popular
  Bulletin Board. For this reason, and to support bases: 2, 8, and 16,
  this conversion is not the radix-64 conversion used in unix-to-unix
  copy (uuencode).  The range of the radix is between 2 and 64.
  
  You may specify the PennMUSH compatable toggle (1) which will mimic Penn's
  64 bit packing algo.
   
  Examples:
    >think pack(629126998)
    bVxTM
    >think pack(629126998,16)
    257FB756
    >think pack(629126998,2)
    100101011111111011011101010110
    >think pack(-629126998)
    -bVxTM
   
  See Also: unpack(), crc32(), mask(), tobin(), tohex(), tooct(), todec(), 
            roman()
  
& UNPACK()
  Function: unpack(<packed number>[[,<radix>][,<penn compat flag>]])
   
  Returns the equivalent normal base-10 number of the given
  packed-number using the specified base. The default radix is 64.
  The inverse function of unpack is pack.  The radix can be between
  2 and 64.
  
  You may specify tghe PennMUSh compatable toggle (1) which will mimic Penn's
  64 bit packing algo.
   
  Examples:
    >think unpack(bVxTM)
    629126998
    >think unpack(1111,2)
    15
   
  See Also: pack(), crc32(), mask(), tobin(), tohex(), tooct(), todec()
  
& CRC32()
  Function: crc32(<string1>[, ..., <stringN>])
   
  Returns the Cyclic Redundancy Check of the strings or sequences of
  strings as a positive number. The answer for the same sequence of
  strings is always the same.  You may specify more than one string
  to do a CRC check against.
   
  The usefulness of this number is broad, but could provide a unique
  fingerprint, checksum pattern, or high-quality hash function.
   
  Example:
    > think crc32(MUX)
    629126998
  
  See Also: pack(), unpack(), mask(), tobin(), tohex(), tooct(), todec(),
            digest()
  
& PARENMATCH()
  Function: parenmatch([<object>/]<attribute>[,<type>])
  
  This function returns an ansified match of parenthesis, brackets, and braces
  while hilighting red any mis-matched of the three.  The comparison will 
  always be left to right.  If the string is too large, it will always be
  returned.  If there are a large number of parenthesis, brackets, and braces,
  it is possible the result will be cut off as ansi takes up extra spaces.
  If this is the case, use type '1' to just return errors (if any).
  
  The following types exist:
    0 - Ansify the string and highlight red the first missmatch found (default)
    1 - If there is a missmatch, ONLY return that, else ansify the string.
  
  Examples:
    > @va me=[add(1,1)]
    > @vb me=[add(1,2))]
    > say parenmatch(vb)
    You say "[add(1,2))]"       (The second ')' would be hilighted red)
    > say parenmatch(vb,1)
    You say "[add(1,2))]"       (Just the second ')' would be colorized)
  
  See Also: brackets(), pos(), totpos()
  
& PARENTS()
  Function: parents(<obj>)
  
  Returns all the parents of <obj>.  Returns #-1 if <obj> cannot be found
  or has no parent or if you do not own and/or control <obj>
  
  Example:
    > say parents(me)
    You say "#-1"
    > @parent #4=#5
    Parent set.
    > @parent #5=#6
    Parent set.
    > say parents(#4)
    You say "#5 #6"
  
  See Also: parent(), children()
  
& CHILDREN()
  Function: children(<obj> [,<key>])
  
  Returns all children (objects parented to <obj>) that can be found.
  As this is somewhat extensive on the CPU, it may be limited to wizards
  only in the future.
  
  The following optional keys are available:
    0 - list all children of the target (default)
    n - List 'n'th 400 children of the target. 
        NOTE: 'n' will be any number from 1 to however many 'pages'
              So '1' would be first 400, '2' would be second 400, etc.
    l - List total pages and total children of target.
    ~ - [~#1-#2] list children starting at #1 until count of #2.
     
  Example:
  > @parent #10=#5
  Parent set.
  > @parent #15=#5
  Parent set.
  > say children(#5)
  You say "#10 #15"
  
  See Also: parents(), parent()
  
& TEL()
  Function: tel(<obj> [<obj2>...],<loc> [<loc2>...] [,<silent>])
  
  This function works like @tel/list works.  It will teleport one or
  more objects to one or more destinations.  It follows the same 
  permissions and restrictions that @tel will follow.  The SIDEFX flag
  is required for this function.  
  
  The value of the optional argument 'silent' can be either 0 or 1. If
  set to 1 then the attributes 'atport', 'otport', 'oxtport' and 'tport'
  are not evaluated.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  The last example teleports you to #0, bob to #2, and joe to #4.
  
  Example:
  > say tel(me,#0)
  You say ""
  The Beginning(#0)
  A simple room
  > @tel/list me=#0
  The Beginning(#0)
  A simple room
  > say tel(me bob joe,#0 #2 #4)
  You say ""
  
  See Also: @tel, move(), SIDEEFFECTS
  
& SET()
  Function: set(<object>,<[!]<flag> [[!]<flag> [!]<flag> ...]>)
            set(<object>,<<attribute>:<value>> [,<tree>])
            set(<object>,<<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>> [,<tree>])
            set(<object>/<attr>,[!]<attrflag>)
  
  The set() function is a side-effect for the @set command.  Everything that
  worked with @set will work with set().  It follows the same permissions and
  restrictions of the command.  The SIDEFX flag is required to use set().
  
  You may specify the optional <tree> of '1' to specifically set a TREE with
  all branches filled (that do not exist) on the target.  A TREE set will
  also verify permission on every branch of that tree prior to setting.  
  Failure to set any of the branches, for any reason, will disallow 
  setting the attribute as well.
  
  The <tree> toggle is ignored on any method of set() that does not 
  set or clear attributes.
   
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @set me=safe
  Set.
  > say set(me,safe)
  You say ""
  
  See Also: rset(), writable(), &, @set, SIDEEFFECTS, ATTRIBUTE TREES
  
& RSET()
  Function: rset(<object>,<[!]<flag> [[!]<flag> [!]<flag> ...]>)
            rset(<object>,<<attribute>:<value>> [,<tree>])
            rset(<object>,<<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>> [,<tree>])
            rset(<object>/<attr>,[!]<attrflag>)
  
  The rset() function is a side-effect for the @set command.  It works nearly
  like the set() sideeffect, except it returns the string that it set. 
  Everything that worked with @set will work with rset().  It follows the 
  same permissions and restrictions of the command.  The SIDEFX flag is 
  required to use rset().
  
  You may specify the optional <tree> of '1' to specifically set a TREE with
  all branches filled (that do not exist) on the target.  A TREE set will
  also verify permission on every branch of that tree prior to setting.  
  Failure to set any of the branches, for any reason, will disallow 
  setting the attribute as well.
  
  The <tree> toggle is ignored on any method of rset() that does not 
  set or clear attributes.
   
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @set me=safe
  Set.
  > say set(me,safe)
  You say ""
  > say rset(me,safe)
  You say "safe"
  
  See Also: set(), writable(), &, @set, SIDEEFFECTS, ATTRIBUTE TREES
  
& toggle()
  Function: toggle(<object>,[!]<toggle>)
  
  The toggle() function is a side-effect for the @toggle command.  It can
  only be used to set and remove toggles.  It follows the same permissions
  and restrictions of the command.  The SIDEFX flag is required to use
  toggle().
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @toggle me=vpage
  Set.
  > say toggle(me,vpage)
  You say ""
  
& PEMIT()
  Function: pemit(<object> [<object2> ...],<string> [,<key>])
  
  The pemit() function is a side-effect for the @pemit/list command.  All
  restrictions and permissions of that command follow this function.  The
  SIDEFX flag is required to use pemit().
  
  You may specify an optional <key> of '1' if you wish to have ##
  substituted for every target object in the list.  Keep in mind the '##'
  is pre-processed like iter's ## would be and could be a security risk
  if used improperly.  I'd strongly suggest filtering the target list
  as dbref#'s to keep it safe.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @pemit/list me me=test
  test
  test
  > say pemit(me me,test)
  test
  test
  You say ""
  > @eval pemit(#123,test ##)		(assuming your dbref# is #123)
  test #123
  
  See Also: @pemit, npemit(), SIDEEFFECTS
  
& NPEMIT()
  Function: npemit(<object> [<object2> ...],<string>)
  
  The npemit() function works like pemit() except it won't strip spaces.
  
  Example:
  > @pemit/list me me=test
  test
  test
  > say npemit(me me,test)
  test
  test
  You say ""
  
  See Also: @pemit, pemit(), SIDEEFFECTS
  
& LINK()
  Function: link(<object>,<target>)
  
  The link() function is a side-effect for the @link command.  All
  restrictions and permissions of that command follow this function.  The
  SIDEFX flag is required to use link().
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @link me=here
  Home set.
  > say link(me,here)
  You say ""
  
  See Also: @link, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& CREATE()
  Function: create(<name>, [<arguments> [,<type>]])
  
  @create:  create(<name>,<value>,t) (default)
    This will create an object with name <name> of value <value>.  The 't'
    <type> is optional for this as it is the default.  For more help on
    creating objects, please refer to 'help @create'.  If <value> is null
    it assumes the default.  All objects made are sent to enactor's location.
  
    If no arguments are given, the default money value is taken for this 
    option only.
  
  @dig:     create(<name>,<[exit-in],[exit-out]>,r)
    This will dig a room with name <name> and OPTIONAL in-exit 'exit-in' and
    OPTIONAL out-exit 'exit-out'.  You may specify both, either, or no exits.
    For more help on digging rooms, please refer to 'help @dig'.
  
  @open:    create(<name>,<link>,e)
    This will open an exit with name <name> to OPTIONAL target <link>.  If
    <link> is unspecified, then the exit will be un-linked and will need to
    be @linked later (if so desired).
  
  The SIDEFX flag needs to be set to use this function. 
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > say create(An Object,10)  (this will create 'An Object' with value of '10')
  > say create(An Object)     (this will create 'An Object' with default cost)
  
  See Also: @create, @dig, @open, dig(), open(), SIDEEFFECTS
  
& LISTMATCH()
  Function: listmatch(<string>, <pattern>[, <delimiter>])
 
  The listmatch() function tries to match <pattern> against <string>. If it
  succeeds, it returns a list of the text that matched each wildcard (up to
  ten) in <pattern>. Normally, the list is space-separated, but if
  <delimiter> is specified, the list will be separated by that instead.
 
  If it fails, or <pattern> contains no wildcards, it returns an empty
  string.
 
  Example:
    > say listmatch(This is a test, *test)
    You say "This is a "
    > say listmatch(hit the troll with the sword, hit * with *, /)
    You say "the troll/the sword"
    > say listmatch(kow, wok)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: setqmatch(), match(), totmatch(), wildmatch()
  
& SETQMATCH()
  Function: setqmatch(<string>, <pattern>[,delim])
 
  The setqmatch() function tries to match <pattern> against <string>. If it
  succeeds, it returns 1 and puts the text that matched each wildcard (up to
  ten) into successive setq registers. The first wildcard's match goes into
  register 0, the second into register 1, etc.
 
  (If it reaches '10' and there's more, dump the remaining into
   '10' if '10' is a '*' wildcard and not a '?' wildcard)
 
  If it fails, it returns 0.  If optional delimiter of 'n' is specified,
  then it returns nothing for failures or successes.  Default is 'y' for
  returning values.
 
  Example:
    > say setqmatch(This is a test, *test) -- [r(0)]
    You say "1 -- This is a "
    > say setqmatch(open the door hal, open * ???) -- [r(0)] -- [r(2)]
    You say "1 -- the door -- a"
    > say setqmatch(kow, wok)
    You say "0"
    > say setqmatch(kow, wok, n)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: listmatch(), match(), totmatch(), wildmatch(), setq()
  
& LIST()
  Function: list(<list>, <eval>[, <delim> ][, <header>][, <target>])
 
  This function works just like iter() but returns each result on a seperate
  line thereby bypassing the buffer limit that RhostMUSH contains.  Each line
  will be a new line and will not be space delimited and will be displayed
  PRIOR to the output of the command calling it.
  
  <list> is a <delimiter>-separated list of strings, which can be object
  numbers, attributes, or arbitrary words.  <eval> is a string that is to be
  evaluated once for each item in <list>, replacing the special symbol ## with
  the corresponding item from <list>.  A space-separated list of the results
  of these evaluations is returned to the caller.  The effect is very similar
  to @dolist, except that the results are made into a list and returned, not
  executed.  The special symbol #@ can be used to return the positional match
  of the current item of the list.  list() will work without SIDEFX.  You may 
  specify an optional <header> which will be displayed prior to the lists.
  <target> optionally sends output to the target player.  You must control
  the target or it will default to the enactor.
  
  You may use %i0-%i9 for itext(0) to itext(9).  
  You may use %il for the outermost layer, equiv to itext(ilev())
   
  {See 'help list2' for examples}

& LIST2
  Function: list(<list>, <eval>[, <delim> ][, <header>][, <target>])
 
  Examples:
    > @emit [list(This test,-## #@-)]
    -This 1-
    -test 2-
    > @emit AA[list(This@is,strlen(##),@)]BB   (notice the output)
    4
    2
    AABB
    > @wait 0={@emit AA;@emit [list(This@is,strlen(##),@)]BB}
    AA
    4
    2
    BB
    > @emit [list(This@is,strlen(%i0),@,AA)]BB
    AA
    4
    2
    BB
    
  See Also: nsiter(), citer(), @dolist, parse(), list()
  
& DIGEST()
  Function: digest(<algorithm>, <string>)
   
  Returns a checksum (Hash, digest, etc.) of <string> using the given
  <algorithm>.  If the mush is compiled with SSL support <algorithm> 
  can be one of:
   
           md2 md4 md5 sha sha1 dss1 mdc2 ripemd160
   
  Without SSL, only the sha algorithm is enabled. 
  
  See '@list options' on what algorithms are supported.
  
  Examples: 
    > say digest(md5, test123)
    You say "cc03e747a6afbbcbf8be7668acfebee5"
    > say digest(sha, test123)
    You say "3a589de6214fd40ae461313fd81dfd1edb7eae70"
   
  See also: crc32(), pack(), roman(), encrypt(), decrypt(), encode64(),
            decode64()

& DIG()
  Function: dig(<room>[[,<in exit>][,<out exit>][,<location>][,<type>]])
  
  This side-effect function mimics the full range of functionality that @dig 
  uses.  It also follows all restrictions and permissions of the @dig command.
  You can dig room name <room> with optional exit from your current location 
  to that room <in exit> and optional exit from the room being created to your
  current room <out exit>.  Neither of the exits are required.  
  
  The optional <location> specifies what location the dig() function is to
  open exits <in exit> from and <out exit> back to.  You must control the
  location, it must be specified as a dbref#, and it must be an object or room.
  
  The optional <type> specifies if the default behavior (with a '0') returns
  just the dbref# of the room created, or if a '1' specifies if the room# with
  the exit TO and the exit FROM be listed on a single line.
  
  This function requires the SIDEFX flag.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
   
  Examples:
    > say dig(My Room)			(without sidefx return values enabled)
    You say ""
    > say dig(Another Room,In <I>;i;in) (with sidefx return values enabled)
    You say "#123"
    > say dig(Yet Another Room,In <I>;i;in,Out <O>;o;out)
    You say "#124"
    > say dig(Yet Another Room,In <I>;i;in,Out <O>;o;out,,1)
    You say "#127 #128 #129"
  
  See Also: create(), open(), @dig, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& OPEN()
  Function: open(<exit>[,<link>][,<location>])
  
  This side-effect function mimics the full range of functionality that @open
  uses.  It also follows all restrictions and permissions of the @open 
  command.  You may open an exit with name <exit> with-out linking it to a 
  destination <link> if you so desire, but the exit would have to be @linked
  (or link()'d) later depending on what you're needs are.  The first example
  just opens an exit without linking it.  The second example opens an exit
  and links it to #0.  
  
  The optional <location> specifies where to open the exit out of.  It must
  be controlled by you, specified as a dbref# and must be an object or room.
  
  The SIDEFX flag is required to use open().
  
  Note:  To make variable exits, you @toggle the exit VARIABLE then set
         an appropiate @exitto on it.
   
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
  
  Examples:
    > say open(My Exit <ME>;my exit;my;exit;me)
    You say ""
    > say open(Another Exit <AE>;another exit;another;exit;ae,#0)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: create(), dig(), link(), @open, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& DESTROY()
  Function: destroy(<object>)
  
  The destroy() function will destroy the targetted object.  You can not
  destroy anything set SAFE or INDESTRUCTABLE with the destroy() function.
  You have to use @destroy for these.  This is for security percautions.
  This will immediately halt anything that the object may be evaluating.
  
  Check @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  Anything using this side-effect must have the SIDEFX flag set.
  
  Example:
    > say destroy(#123)
    You say ""
   
  See Also: @destroy, wipe(), create()
  
& WIPE()
  Function: wipe(<obj>[/wildattr] [,<regexp>])
  
  The wipe() function will remove all matching attributes specified by
  a wildcard, or, if no attribute is specified, remove all attributes of
  the specified object.  This function works like @wipe and follows all
  permissions and restrictions of the matching command.
  
  If <regexp> is specified as '1', then <wildattr> is evaluated as a
  regular expresion instead of the default expresion.
  
  Check @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  Anything using this side-effect must have the SIDEFX flag set.
  
  Examples:
    > say wipe(#123/*foo*)
    You say "Wipe: 8 attributes wiped."
    > say wipe(#123/^.*ab$,1)
    You say "Wipe: 2 attributes wiped."
    > say wipe(#123)
    You say "Wipe: 218 attributes wiped."
  
  See Also: @wipe, @set, &, set()
  
& ZEMIT()
  Function: zemit(<list of zones>,<text>)
  
  The zemit() function returns 'text' to every room of every zone in
  the specified list.  If the target zone is not a zonemaster, but still
  is contained in a zone, then it will just return the text to that room.
  
  This works similiarilly to @pemit/zone/list
  
  Check @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.  
  Anything using this side-effect must have the SIDEFX flag set.
  
  Examples:
    > @zone here=#0
    > say zemit(#0,blarg)
    blarg   (Note: blarg will have been sent to all rooms of the zonemaster!)
    You say ""
    > say zemit(here,blarg)
    blarg   (Note: blarg is just sent to this current room)
    You say ""
    > @zone/purge here
    > say zemit(here,blarg)
    Invalid zone.
    You say ""
  
  See Also: @pemit, @emit, emit()
  
& EMIT()
  Function: emit(<text>)
  
  The emit() function returns 'text' to your location exactly as the @emit
  command does.  It follows all restrictions and permissions of @emit.
  The SIDEFX flag is required to use this function.
   
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
   
  Examples:
    > say emit(boo!)
    boo!
    You say ""
  
  See Also: lemit(), pemit(), oemit(), @emit, SIDEEFFECTS
    
& OEMIT()
  Function: oemit(<target>, <text> [,<key>])
  
  The oemit() function returns 'text' at location of 'target' without letting
  'target' know what was emitted.  This works identical to the @oemit command
  and follows all permissions and restrictions.  The SIDEFX flag is required
  to be able to use the oemit() function.
  
  An optional key of <key> may be specified to toggle the affect of having
  <target> be multiple arguments.  A <key> of '1' enables multi-targetting.
   
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
  
  Examples:
    > say oemit(TinyPlayer,boo!)
    boo!
    You say ""
    > say oemit(me,boo!)
    You say ""
    > say oemit(me you them,boo!,1)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: lemit(), pemit(), emit(), @oemit, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& LEMIT()
  Function: lemit(<text>)
  
  The lemit() function works just like @emit/room.  It will display <text> at
  the outermost room from the enactor.  If no room is found, no text will be
  outputted.  The SIDEFX flag is required to be able to use this function.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
  
  Examples:
    > say lemit(boo!)
    boo!
    You say ""
  
  See Also: emit(), pemit(), oemit(), @emit, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& CLONE()
  Function: clone(<object>[[,<new name>][,<key>])
  
  The clone() function will clone <object> with the optional new name of
  <new name>.  It follows all permissions and restrictions that the @clone
  command requires.  The SIDEFX flag is required to be able to use this
  function.
  
  The following keys are available for clone():
      1 - issue a PARENT clone                (normal rules apply)
      2 - issue a PRESERVE clone              (wizard only)
      3 - issue a PARENT and PRESERVE clone   (wizard only)
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect function is enabled.
  
  Examples:
    > say clone(An Object)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: create(), dig(), open(), @clone, SIDEEFFECTS
  
& PARENT()
  Function: parent(<obj>[,<parent>])
 
  Returns the parent of <obj>.  Returns #-1 if <obj> cannot be found or
  if you do not own <obj> and it is not set VISUAL.
 
  If side-effects are enabled, specifying a parent will cause it to be
  parented to that object.  If side-effects are not enabled, you will
  get an error message.  The SIDEFX flag is required to use the side-effect.
  Type @list options to see if the side-effect portion of parent() is enabled.
  The sideeffect will return the dbref# of the parent it set it to or #-1
  if the parent was not set.
  
  Example:
    > say parent(me)
    You say "#-1"
    > say My va is [v(va)].
    You say "My va is "
    > @parent me=test
    Parent set.
    > say parent(me) and my va is [v(va)].
    You say "#123 and my va is Testing 123"
    > say parent(me,#0)
    You say ""
    > say parent(me)
    You say "#0"
  
  See Also: @parent, PARENT OBJECTS, parents(), children()
  
& SIGN()
  Function: sign(<number>)
 
  Returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether its argument is negative, zero, or
  positive (respectively).
 
  Example:
  > say sign(-4)
  You say "-1"
  > say sign(4)
  You say "1"
  > say sign(0)
  You say "0"
  > say sign(-1)
  You say "-1"
  
  See Also: abs()
  
& CONN()
  Function: conn(<player> [,<boolean> [,<port>]])
 
  Returns the number of seconds that <player> has been connected.  If <player>
  is not connected then -1 is returned.  If <player> is connected more than
  once, the longest connect time is returned.
  
  You may specify an optional boolean value of '1' to return the result in
  the form '<port>:<conntime>'.  You may also specify the port of the player
  for an exact match of their conn() time.
   
  Example:
    > WHO
    Player Name          On For Idle  Doing
    Wizard                00:04   1m
    Evinar                00:12   6m  
    Wizard                00:32   6s  
    3 Players logged in.
    > say conn(wiz)
    You say "2125"
    > say conn(wiz,1)
    You say "12:251 14:2125"
    > say conn(e)
    You say "770"
  
  See Also: WHO, idle(), lwho()
  
& IDLE()
  Function: idle(<player> [,<boolean> [,<port>]))
 
  Returns the number of seconds that <player> has been idle.  If <player>
  is not connected then -1 is returned.  If <player> is connected more than
  once, the smallest idle time is returned.
  
  You may specify an optional boolean value for the type.  If '1' is chosen 
  it will output in the form '<port>:<idle>'.  You may specify the exact port 
  of the player for an exact idle() match.
  
  Example:
    > WHO
    Player Name          On For Idle  Doing
    Wizard                00:04   1m
    Evinar                00:12   6m  
    Wizard                00:32   6s  
    3 Players logged in.
    > say idle(wiz)
    You say "6"
    > say idle(wiz,1)
    You say "12:68 14:6"
    > say idle(frobozz)
    You say "-1"
  
  See Also: WHO, conn(), lwho()
  
& CONVSECS()
  Function: convsecs(<seconds>)
 
  This function converts seconds to a time string, based on how many
  seconds the number is after Jan 1, 1970.
 
  Example:
    > say secs()
    You say "709395750"
    > say convsecs(709395750)
    You say "Wed Jun 24 10:22:54 1992"
  This function may also be called as secs2time().
  
  See Also: convtime(), secs(), time(), timefmt()
  
& CONVTIME()
  Function: convtime(<time string>)
 
  This functions converts a time string to the number of seconds since
  Jan 1, 1970. A time string is of the format: Ddd MMM DD HH:MM:SS YYYY
  where Ddd is the day of the week, MMM is the month, DD is the day
  of the month, HH is the hour in 24-hour time, MM is the minutes,
  SS is the seconds, and YYYY is the year.
  If you supply an incorrectly formatted string, it will return -1.
 
  Example:
    > say time()
    You say "Wed Jun 24 10:22:54 1992"
    > say convtime(Wed Jun 24 10:22:54 1992)
    You say "709395774"
  
  This function may also be called as time2secs().
  
  This function, if allowing enhanced time formats, can handle a
  varying method of other formats.  Please see '@list options convtime'
  to see the available extra formats (if available).
  
  Enhanced date checking is handled with the 'enhanced_convtime' param.
  
  See Also: convsecs(), secs(), time(), timefmt()
  
& SORT()
  Function: sort(<list>[, <sort type>[, <delim> [, <sep>]]])
   
  * Takes a list of words, numbers, or dbref, and sorts them into ascending
    order.  Lexicographic order is used for words, and numeric order is used
    for numbers and dbrefs.
  * <sort type> may be used to specify the type of sort to perform (use d for
    dbref, n for integer numeric, f for floating numeric, and a for
    alphanumeric).  If omitted or left blank, the sort() function will
    automatically determine the type of sort to perform.
  * If <delim> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to separate items
    in the list.  You may specify an alternate delimiter without specifying
    a sort type by passing a null <sort type> parameter.
  * If <sep> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to seperate items
    in the output.
   
  Examples:
    > say sort(This is a test)
    You say "This a is test"
    > say sort(98 99 100 101)
    You say "98 99 100 102"
    > say sort(foo-bar-bletch,,-)
    You say "bar-bletch-foo"
    > say sort(foo-bar-bletch,,-,+)
    You say "bar+bletch+foo"
  
  See Also: sortby(), munge(), map(), setinter(), setunion(), setdiff(),
            sortlist()
  
& SORTLIST()
  Function: sortlist(<order>, <sep>, <list1>, <list2>, [...,<listN>])
  
  This function takes 2 or more lists and chooses from each sample the max
  or min value based on the sorting value type.  The <order> must have as the
  first character a + for maxsort or a - for minsort.  If you do not specify
  a sort type after the +/- or if the value is invalid, it assumes alphanum.
  
  The lists may be unequal lists.
  
  The following <order> types are allowed:  
    +a  -- (default) sort alphanumerically by maximum value 
    -a  -- (default) sort alphanumerically by minimum value
    +n  -- sort integers numerically by maximum value
    -n  -- sort integers numerically by minimum value
    +f  -- sort floating numerically by maximum value
    -f  -- sort floating numerically by minimum value
    +d  -- sort dbref#'s numerically by maximum valid dbref# (#-1 if invalid)
    -d  -- sort dbref#'s numerically by minimum valid dbref# (#-1 if invalid)
  
  With the dbref# sort, any invalid dbref# is assigned the value #-1.  If all
  arguments in that list order are all invalid, #-1 will be seen for the
  value.
  
  Examples:
    > say sortlist(+n,,1 2 3,10 0 20, 0 0 0)
    You say "10 2 20"
    > say sortlist(-n,,1 2 3,10 0 20, -100 100 200)
    You say "-100 0 3"
    > say sortlist(-n,:,1:2:3,5:6:7,4:4:4,0:9:20)
    You say "5:9:20"
    > say sortlist(+f,,1.2 2.5 3.3,1.3 2.4 -1.2)

& SORTBY()
  Function: sortby([<obj>/]<attrib>,<list>[,<delim> [,<sep>]])
  
  This sorts an arbitrary list according to the u-function <obj>/<attrib>.
  This u-function should compare two arbitrary elements, %0 and %1, and
  return zero (equal), a negative integer (element 1 is less than element 2)
  or a positive integer (element 1 is greater than element 2).
  
  A simple example, which imitates a normal alphabetic sort:
    > &ALPHASORT test=[comp(%0,%1)]
    > say [sortby(test/ALPHASORT,foo bar baz)]
    You say "bar baz foo"
  
  A slightly more complicated sort. #1 is "God", #2 is "Amby", "#3" is "Bob":
    > &NAMESORT me=[comp(name(%0),name(%1))]
    > say [sortby(NAMESORT,#1 #2 #3)]
    You say "#2 #3 #1"
  
  Warning: the function invocation limit applies to this function. If
  this limit is exceeded, the function will fail _silently_. List and
  function sizes should be kept reasonable.

& LISTDIFF()
  Function: listdiff(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep>] [,<type>]]])
  
  This function returns the difference of two sets, keeping the order of the
  first set.  Any element in <list1> that is not in <list2> will be 
  displayed.  The following types exist:
  
      0 - remove duplicates from lists (default)
      1 - show list with duplicates
  
  Example:
    > say listdiff(foo baz gleep bar foo foo, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "foo baz"
    > say listdiff(foo baz gleep bar foo foo, bar moof gleep,,-)
    You say, "foo-baz"
    > say listdiff(foo baz gleep bar foo foo, bar moof gleep,,-,1)
    You say, "foo-baz-foo-foo"
  
  See Also: listunion(), listinter(), setdiff()

& SETDIFF()
  Function: setdiff(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep> [, <sorttype>]]])
   
  This function returns the difference of two sets -- i.e., the elements in
  <list1> that aren't in <list2>. The list that is returned is sorted.
   
  If <delim> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to separate items
  in the list.
  
  If <sep> is specified, it will be used (rather than a space) for the output
  seperator for the list.
  
  If <sorttype> is specified, you may have a different sort than the default
  alphanumerical sort.  (d)bref, (n)umeric, (f)loat, (a)lphanumeric.
   
  Example:
    > say setdiff(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "baz foo"
    > say setdiff(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep,,-)
    You say, "baz-foo"
  
  See Also: setinter(), setunion(), sort(), listdiff()
  
& LISTINTER()
  Function: listinter(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep>] [,<type>]]])
  
  This function returns the intersection of two sets, keeping the order of the
  first set.  Any element in <list1> that is in <list2> will be
  displayed.  The following types exist:
  
      0 - remove duplicates from lists (default)
      1 - show list with duplicates
  
  Example:
    > say listinter(foo baz gleep bar foo bar, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "gleep bar"
    > say listinter(foo baz gleep bar foo bar, bar moof gleep,,-)

    You say, "gleep-bar-bar"
  
  See Also: listunion(), listdiff(), setinter()


& SETINTER()
  Function: setinter(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep> [, <sorttype>]]])
   
  This function returns the intersection of two sets -- i.e., the elements
  that are in both <list1> and <list2>. The list that is returned is sorted.
  
  If <delim> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to separate items
  in the list.
   
  If <sep> is specified, it will be used (rather than a space) for the output
  seperator for the list.
  
  If <sorttype> is specified, you may have a different sort than the default
  alphanumerical sort.  (d)bref, (n)umeric, (f)loat, (a)lphanumeric.
  
  Example:
    > say setinter(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "bar gleep"
    > say setinter(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep,,-)
    You say, "bar-gleep"
  
  See Also: setdiff(), setunion(), sort(), listinter()
  
& LISTUNION()
  Function: listunion(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep>] [,<type>]]])
  
  This function returns the union of two sets, keeping the order of the
  first set.  Any element in <list2> that is not in <list1> will be
  appended to the list in <list1>.  The following types exist:
  
      0 - remove duplicates from lists (default)
      1 - show list with duplicates
  
  Example:
    > say listunion(foo baz gleep bar foo bar, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "foo baz gleep bar moof"
    > say listunion(foo baz gleep bar foo bar, bar moof gleep,,-)
    You say, "foo-baz-gleep-bar-moof"
    > say listunion(foo baz gleep bar foo bar, bar moof gleep,,-,1)
    You say, "foo-baz-gleep-bar-foo-bar-moof"
  
  See Also: listinter(), listdiff(), setunion()

& SETUNION()
  Function: setunion(<list1>, <list2>[, <delim> [, <sep> [, <sorttype>]]])
   
  This function returns the union of two sets -- i.e., all the elements of
  both <list1> and <list2>, minus any duplicate elements. Think of it as
  CAT() without duplicated words.  The list returned is sorted.
   
  If <delim> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to separate items
  in the list.
   
  If <sep> is specified, it will be used (rather than a space) for the output
  seperator for the list.
  
  If <sorttype> is specified, you may have a different sort than the default
  alphanumerical sort.  (d)bref, (n)umeric, (f)loat, (a)lphanumeric.
   
  Example:
    > say setunion(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep)
    You say, "bar baz foo gleep moof"
    > say setunion(foo baz gleep bar, bar moof gleep,,-)
    You say, "bar-baz-foo-gleep-moof"
  
  See Also: setdiff(), setinter(), sort(), listunion()
  
& MERGE()
  Function: merge(<string1>,<string2>,<character>)
  
  This function merges <string1> and <string2>, depending on <character>.
  If a character in <string1> is the same as <character>, it is replaced
  by the character in the corresponding position in <string2>.  The two
  strings must be of the same length.
  
  Spaces need to be treated specially. A null character is considered to
  equal a space, for <character>.
  
  Examples:
    > say merge(AB--EF,abcdef,-)
    You say, "ABcdEF"
    > say merge(AB[space(2)]EF,abcdef,)
    You say, "ABcdEF"
  
  See Also: splice(), tr()
  
& REPEAT()
  Function: repeat(<string>,<number>)
  
  This function simply repeats <string>, <number> times.  No spaces are
  inserted between each repetition.
  
  Example:
    > say repeat(Test, 5)
    You say, "TestTestTestTestTest"
  
  See Also: space()
  
& SPLICE()
  Function: splice(<list1>, <list2>, <word>[, <delim> [, <sep> ]])
  
  This function splices <list1> and <list2> together. <list1> and <list2>
  are space-separated lists of words
  
  If a word in <list1> is the same as <word>, it is replaced by the word
  in the corresponding position in <list2>.  Both lists must have the
  same number of words.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.  
  
  <sep> may be used to specify an output seperator other than a space.
   
  Example:
    > say splice(foo bar baz,eek moof gleep,bar)
    You say, "foo moof baz"
    > say splice(foo bar baz,eek moof gleep,bar,,-)
    You say, "foo-moof-baz"
  
  See Also: merge()
  
& PMATCH()
  Function: pmatch(<target>)
  
  This function returns the dbref# of the matching player.  It returns '#-1'
  if no player was found.
  
  You may specify a valid player dbref#, *player, or player.
  
  Example:
    > say %n %#
    You say "Bob #1234"
    > say pmatch(bob)
    You say "#1234"
    > say pmatch(#1234)
    You say "#1234"
    > say pmatch(*bob)
    You say "#1234"
  
  See Also: num(), pfind()
  
& PFIND()
  Function: pfind(<target>)
  
  This function works similiar to pmatch, except it will return any valid 
  dbref# when a dbref# is entered.  This also does not accept *player.
  
  This is provided for compatibility purposes to other codebases.
  
  Example:
    > say pfind(Bob)
    You say "#1234"
  
  See Also: num(), pmatch()
  
& LLOC()
  Function: lloc(<target>)
  
  This function returns all the locations of the player until a condition
  is met.  
  
  Condition #1:  The first room is found and it exits normally.
  Condition #2:  It surpasses the max drill-down of locations (20)
  Condition #3:  It detects recursive contents.
  
  Example:
    > @dig Room
    Room created with room number 1768.
    > @tel #1768
    Room(#1768)
    > @create An Object
    An Object created as object #1767
    > @drop An Object
    Dropped.
    > enter An Object
    An Object(#1767)
    > say lloc(me)
    You say "#1767 #1768"

& BETWEEN()
  Function: between(<value1>,<value2>,<number>[,<boolean>])
  
  This function will return TRUE (1) if <number> is between
  the values <value1> and <value2>.  If you specify the 
  optional boolean '1', it will see if the <number> is 
  between OR the values <value1> and <value2>.
  
  Example:
    > say between(10,15,14)
    You say "1"
    > say between(10,15,15)
    You say "0"
    > say between(10,15,15,1)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: fbetween(), fbound(), bound(), gt(), lt(), gte(), lte()
  
& FBETWEEN()
  Function: fbetween(<value1>,<value2>,<number>[,<boolean>])
  
  This function will return TRUE (1) if <number> is between
  the values <value1> and <value2>.  If you specify the 
  optional boolean '1', it will see if the <number> is 
  between OR the values <value1> and <value2>.  This works
  like between() but handles floating point numbers.  This
  will round the values to the nearest significant 6th digit.
  
  Example:
    > say fbetween(10.01,15.01,14.5)
    You say "1"
    > say fbetween(10.5,15.20,15.20)
    You say "0"
    > say fbetween(10.5,15.20,15.20,1)
    You say "1"
  
  See Also: between(), fbound(), bound(), gt(), lt(), gte(), lte()

& BRACKETS()
  Function: brackets([<string>])
   
  Returns a count of the number of left and right square brackets,
  parentheses, and curly braces in the string, in that order, as a
  space-separated list of numbers. This is useful for finding missing
  or extra brackets in MUSH code.
   
  Example:
  > @desc me=This is [ansi(h,a test)] of the { brackets() function.
  Set.
  > think brackets(v(desc))
  1 1 2 2 1 0             (This is: 1-[, 1-], 2-(, 2-), 1-{, 0-})
  
  See Also: totpos(), numpos(), nummatch(), totmatch()
  
& BOUND()
  Function: bound(<number>,<min-value>[,<max-value>])
  
  This function will return <number> if greater than min-value, else it will 
  return min-value.  If max-value exists, and number is greater than max-value
  then max-value is used.
  
  Example:
    > say bound(8,12)
    You say "12"
    > say bound(8,12,10)
    You say "10"
  
  See Also: between(), fbetween(), fbound(), gt(), lt(), gte(), lte()

& FBOUND()
  Function: fbound(<number>,<min-value>[,<max-value>])
  
  This function will return <number> if greater than min-value, else it will 
  return min-value.  If max-value exists, and number is greater than max-value
  then max-value is used.  This works like bound() but takes floating point
  values.  All floating point values are rounded to the 6th digit.
  
  Example:
    > say fbound(8.1,12.1)
    You say "12.1"
    > say fbound(8.1,12.1,10.1)
    You say "10.1"
  
  See Also: between(), fbetween(), bound(), gt(), lt(), gte(), lte()
  
& AVG()
  Function: avg(<value1>,<value2>[,<value3>,...])
           mean(<value1>,<value2>[,<value3>,...])  (aliased)
  
  This function takes two more more values and returns the average of
  the values.
  
  Example:
    > say avg(5,6)
    You say "5.5"
    > say avg(5,6,7)
    You say "6"
  
  See Also: round(), trunc(), floor(), ceil()
  
& SOUNDEX()
  Function: soundex(<word>)
   
  The soundex function returns the soundex pattern for a word.
  A soundex pattern represents the sound of the word, and similar
  sounding words should have the same soundex pattern. Soundex patterns
  consist of an uppercase letter and 3 digits.
   
  Example:
    > think soundex(foobar)
    F160
   
  For details of how the algorithm works, see help soundex2
  
  See Also: soundlike()
  
& SOUNDEX2
  Here's how the soundex algorithm works:
  1. The first letter of the soundex code is the first letter of
     the word (exception: words starting with PH get a soundex
     starting with F)
  2. Each remaining letter is converted to a number:
      vowels, h, w, y ---------> 0
      b, p, f, v --------------> 1
      c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z --> 2
      d, t --------------------> 3
      l -----------------------> 4
      m, n --------------------> 5
      r -----------------------> 6
     At this stage, "foobar" is "F00106" 
  3. Strings of the same number are condensed. "F0106"
  4. All 0's are removed, because vowels are much less important
     than consonants in distinguishing words. "F16"
  5. The string is padded with 0's or truncated to 4 characters. "F160"
  That's it. It's not foolproof (enough = "E520", enuf = "E510") but
  it works pretty well. :)

& SOUNDLIKE()
  Function: soundlike(<word>,<word>)
  Function: soundslike(<word>,<word>) (aliased)
   
  The soundslike function returns 1 if the two words have the same
  soundex code (see help soundex() for information), which means, 
  in general, if they sound alike. For example:

    > think soundlike(robin,robbyn)
    1
    > think soundlike(robin,roebuck)
    0

& VADD()
  Function: vadd(<vector>,<vector>[[,<delimiter>],<seperator>])
   
  Returns the sum of two vectors.  A vector is a list of numbers
  separated by spaces or a delimiter.  The vector lists must contain
  the same number of items or it will return an error.  You may
  specify an optional output seperator.
   
  Examples:
    > think vadd(1 2 3,4 5 6)
    5 7 9
    > think vadd(0|0|0,1|2|3,|)
    1|2|3
    > think vadd(0|0|0,1|2|3,|,@)
    1@2@3
  
  See Also: vdim(), vunit(), vdot(), vmul(), vsub(), vmag(), vcross()
  
& VDIM()
  Function: vdim(<vector>[,<delimiter>])

  an optional output seperator.
   
  Examples:
    > think vunit(2 0 0)
    1 0 0
    > think vunit(2 0 0,,@)
    1@0@0
    > think vmul(vunit(5 6 7),vmag(5 6 7))
    5 6 7
  
  See Also: vadd(), vdim(), vdot(), vmul(), vsub(), vmag(), vcross()
  
& VDOT()
  Function: vdot(<vector>,<vector>[,<delimiter>])
  
  Returns the dot product of two vectors. A dot product is the sum
  of the products of the corresponding elements of the two
  vectors, e.g. vdot(a b c,d e f) = ad + be + cf.
  The vectors must be of the same length.
  
  Example:
    > think vdot(1 2 3,2 3 4)
    20
  
  See Also: vadd(), vdim(), vunit(), vmul(), vsub(), vmag(), vcross()
  
& VMUL()
  Function: vmul(<vector|number>,<vector|number>[[,<delimiter>],<seperator>])
   
  Returns the result of either multiplying a vector by a number,
  or the elementwise product of two vectors.  This function may take an 
  optional output seperator.
  
  Examples: 
    > think vmul(1 2 3,2)      (this is a vector by number)
    2 4 6
    > think vmul(1 2 3,2 3 4)  (this is a vector by vector)

& VSUB()
  Function: vsub(<vector>,<vector>[[,<delimiter>],<seperator>])
   
  Returns the difference between two vectors.  The vectors must be
  the same length.  This function may take an optional output
  seperator.
   
  Example:
    > think vsub(3 4 5,3 2 1)
    0 2 4
    > think vsub(3 4 5,3 2 1,,@)
    0@2@4
  
  See Also: vadd(), vdim(), vunit(), vdot(), vmul(), vmag(), vcross()
  
& VMAG()
  Function: vmag(<vector>[,<delimiter>]
   
  Returns the magnitude of a vector, using a euclidean distance metric.
  That is, for vector a b c d, returns sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2).
  The vectors must be the same length.
   
  Example:

  vectors is a vector.  This function may take an optional seperator.
  
                          | a b c |
  (a,b,c) X (d,e,f) = det | d e f | = i(bf-ce) + j(cd-af) + k(ae-bd)
                          | i j k |
  
  where i, j, and k are taken as unit vectors in cartisian space.
   
  Examples:
  > @pemit me=vcross(1 2 3,2 3 4)
  -1 2 -1
  > @pemit me=vcross(1 2 3,2 3 4,,@)
  -1@2@-1

& PID()
  Function: pid([<display> [,<seperator> [,<type> [,<target>]]])
  
  This function returns the queue process table based on various arguments.
  
  <display> is one of a bitwise mask of the following:
    0    -  (default) show just the pids of all the processes
    1    -  Show just the pids of all the processes
    2    -  Show the owners of all the processes
    4    -  Show the enactor of all the processes
    8    -  Show the wait times of all the processes (semaphores have '0')
    16   -  Show the STOP/RUNNING status of all the processes
    32   -  Show the commands queued for all the processes.
  
  Adding the <display> values will return a combination of the values seperated
  by the pipe (|) character.
  
  <seperator> is your output seperator that you wish between processes.  
  Default is a space.
  
  <type> can be one of many types.
    q    - show all queued (waited and semaphores) queued.  (default)
    w    - show all wait jobs
    s    - show all semaphore jobs
    p    - show all player queue jobs (jobs currently being ran)
    o    - show all object queue jobs (jobs currently being ran)
  
  <target> is an optional target to narrow down queue values.  The <target> 
  may be a player or a process ID (PID).  Default is everyone.

& ACCENT()
  Function: accent(<string>,<template>)
  
  The accent() function will return <string>, with characters in it
  possibly changed to accented ones according to <template>. Both
  arguments must be the same number of characters.
  
  Whether or not the resulting string is actually displayed correctly
  is client-dependent. Some OSes uses different character sets than
  the one assumed (ISO 8859-1), and some clients strip these 8-bit
  characters.
  
  You may also use the markup character %f to specify accents.
  To do that you would specify the <template> character after %f
  and then a 'n' to normalize it.
   
  You must be @toggled ACCENTS to be able to use accents. 
  
  ZENTY_ANSI must be compiled in to be able to use accents.

  See Also: chr(), asc(), strip(), stripansi(), tr(), accent(), ACCENTS.

  
& ACOS()
  Function: acos(<number> [,<units>])
   
  Returns the arc-cosine of <number>, expressed in radians.
   
  You may specify <units> which are either (r)adians,
  (g)radians, or (d)egrees.  (r)adians are the default.
   
  Examples:
    > say acos(0)
    You say "1.570796"
    > say acos(1)

& ATAN()
& ATAN2()
  Function: atan(<number> [,<units>])
            atan2(<number1>, <number2> [,<units>]
  
  ATAN Returns the arctangent of <number>, expressed in radians.
  
  ATAN2 Returns the arctangent of <number1> divided by <number2> in radians.
  This is equivelant to atan(fdiv(<number1>,<number2>)[,<units>]) but allows
  a '0' divider without a divide by zero error.
   
  You may specify <units> which are either (r)adians,
  (g)radians, or (d)egrees.  (r)adians are the default.
  
  Examples:
    > say atan(0)
    You say "0"
    > say atan(1)
    You say "0.785398"
    > say atan2(90,90)
    You say "0.785398"
    > say atan(1.557408)
    You say "1"
    > say atan2(90,25)
    You say "1.299849"
  
  See Also: acos(), asin(), cos(), pi(), sin(), tan(), ctu(), cosh(), sinh(),
            tanh(), atan2()
  
& FLOOR()
  Function: floor(<number>)
 
  Returns the largest integer less than or equal to <number>.  <number> may be
  a floating point number, and an integer result is returned.
 
  Examples:
    > say floor(5)
    You say "5"
    > say floor(5.2)
    You say "5"
    > say floor(5.8)
    You say "5"
    > say floor(-5)
    You say "-5"
    > say floor(-5.2)
    You say "-6"
   
  See Also: ceil(), div(), mod(), round(), trunc()
  
& FLOORDIV()
  Function: floordiv(<number1>,<number2>)
   
  Returns the integer quotient from dividing <number1> by <number2>.
   
  However, integer division for the case where either <integer1> or
  <integer2> is negative is defined in a specific way -- by choosing
  the largest integer that is less than or equal to the algebraic
  quotient. If <integer1> and <integer2> are the same sign, then
  idiv() and floordiv() are equivalent.
   
  For example, division of -9 by 5 would give -2 by this definition
  instead of -1. idiv() would return -1. floordiv() would return -2.
  The floordiv() function goes with the mod() function.
   
  floordiv(x,y)*y + mod(x,y) ==> x
   
  Examples:
    > say floordiv(17,3)
    You say "5"
    > say floordiv(18,3)
    You say "6"
    > say floordiv(-17,3)
    You say "-6"
   
  See Also: fdiv(), div(), mul(), sub(), mod()
  
& CEIL()
  Function: ceil(<number>)
 
  Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to <number>.  <number>
  may be a floating point number, and an integer result is returned.
 
  Examples:
    > say ceil(5)
    You say "5"
    > say ceil(5.2)
    You say "6"
    > say ceil(5.8)
    You say "6"
    > say ceil(-5)
    You say "-5"
    > say ceil(-5.2)
    You say "-5"
  
  See Also: div(), floor(), mod(), round(), trunc()
  
& TR()
  Function: tr(<string>, <find>, <replace> [,<type>])

  This function translates every character in <string> that exists in
  <find> to the character at an identical position in <replace>. 
  
  If you specify the <type> of '1', then tr by default will not be made 
  ansi-aware and also process strings faster without the ansi overhead.
  The default value is '0' which allows tr() to be fully ansi-aware.
   
  Ranges of characters seperated by -'s are accepted. <find> and <replace> 
  must be the same length after expansion of ranges. If a character exists 
  more than once in <find>, only the last instance will be counted. The example
  below is the common ROT-13 algorithm for lower case strings, demonstrated
  with every letter explicitly listed, and with the equivalent but briefer 
  character ranges. Literal -'s can be in <find> and <replace> if they are the
  first or last characters in the arguments.
  
  Note: the config param 'ansi_default' handles if the ansi handling is 
        configured default or not.  In which case the 'type' is reversed.
   
  Examples:
    > say tr(hello,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm)
      You say, "uryyb"
    > say tr(uryyb, a-z, n-za-m)
      You say, "hello"
 
  See also: merge(), foreach(), garble(), creplace(), edit(), editansi()

& TRUNC()
  Function: trunc(<number>)
 
  Returns the value of <number> after truncating off any fractional value.
  <number> may be a floating point number, and an integer result is returned.
 
  Examples:
    > say trunc(5)
    You say "5"
    > say trunc(5.2)
    You say "5"
    > say trunc(5.8)
    You say "5"
    > say trunc(-5)
    You say "-5"
    > say trunc(-5.2)
    You say "-5"
  
  See Also: div(), floor(), mod(), round()
  
& ROUND()
  Function: round(<number>,<places>)
 
  Rounds <number> to <places> decimal places.  <number> may be
  a floating point number, and an integer result is returned.
  
  You may specify a negative number to places to specfy a whole number
  rounding.
   
  Examples:
    > say round(5,0)
    You say "5"
    > say round(5.123,1)
    You say "5.1"
    > say round(9.8765,3)

    You say "6"
    > say round(-5.5,0)

    You say "1.414214"
    > say sqrt(100)
    You say "10"
    > say sqrt(0)
    You say "0"
    > say sqrt(-1)

  See Also: e(), log(), ln(), power(), power10()
  
& FOREACH()
  Function: foreach([<object>/]<attribute>,<string>[,<begin>, <end>])
   
  Each character in <string> has the user-defined function of the first
  argument performed on it; the character is passed to the function as
  %0. The position of the argument is passed as %1.  The results are 
  concatenated. If <begin> and <end> are specified, only the characters 
  between <begin> and <end> are parsed, other characters are concatenated 
  as they are. This allows a rudimentary form of tokens and speeds up 
  the evaluation greatly if tokenizing is your purpose.
   
  Examples:
    > &add_one me=[add(%0,1)]
    Set.
    > say [foreach(add_one, 54321)]
    You say, "65432"
    > &add_one me=[add(%0,1)]
    Set.
    > say [foreach(add_one, This adds #0# to numbers in this string,#,#)]

  Function: parse(<list>,<eval>[,<delimiter> [,<output seperator>]])
  
  This function takes each element of <list>, evaluates <eval> after
  substituting it for ##, and constructs a space-separated list of the
  results.  The special substitution of #@ can be used for the position
  of the current item in the list.  You may specify an output seperator.
  
  This function can be reproduced with the iter function and as
  such is considered depreciated but left for compatibility.
  
  This function does not handle itext/inum/%i.  Use iter() for this.
   
  Examples:
    > say nsiter(lnum(3),--+#@)
    You say "--+1--+2--+3--+4"
    > say nsiter(lnum(4),--+)
    You say "--+--+--+--+"
    > say nsiter(This is a test,strlen(##))
    You say "4214"
    > say nsiter(This is a test,{strlen(##)})
    You say "4214"
    > say nsiter(lnum(10),mul(mul(##,##),10))
    You say "0104090160250360490640810"
    > say nsiter(lcon(me),[name(##)]..[money(##)])
    You say "test..1t1..1radio..1The Wizard's Pointy Hat..1"
    > say nsiter(Was it a cat I saw,words(##),s)
    You say "141"

& PARSESTR()
  Function: parsestr(<string>, <eval> [,<delim> [.<output> [,<type>]
                       [,[&]<target>] [,<transchar> [,<endchar> [,<transeval>]
                       [,<prefix>]]]]])
  
  This function takes an input string and parses it, based on the 
  delimiters, in a 'staggered' method, and passes each substring to
  the 'eval' as %0.  This is handy for parsing speech for example.
  
  Arguments are:
    <string>    -- input string that you wish to parse & translate
    <eval>      -- how you wish to parse each segment of the string. 
    <delim>     -- the optional input delimiter of the string
    <output>    -- the optional output delimiter of the string.
                   Note: if you have a space-separated argument, then
                         the first part is prefix, the rest is suffix.
    <type>      -- Take arguments between delimiters as even (default) or odd.
    <target>    -- The target you wish to have if initializer specified.
                   Note: a '&' prefix takes the string 'as-is'.  You must
                         control the target for the target to work.
    <transchar> -- The translation character after the 'delimiter' you wish
                   to identify the string for special processing.
    <endchar>   -- The last character in the field you wish to do special
                   processing on. (good for punctuation)
    <transeval> -- How you wish to parse the special processing string.
    <prefix>    -- The optional eval'd prefix to use for the 'say' string.
  
  Note on <eval>: All arguments passed will be as in the <eval> and <transeval>
            %0  -- The string being passed for evaluation.      
  (prefix)  %1  -- The player name specified in target          (or &string).
  (prefix)  %2  -- The current parameter number being processed (-1 for prefix)
  (prefix)  %3  -- The absolute parameter being processed       (0 for prefix)
  (prefix)  %4  -- The transchar OR endchar being processed     (if any)
  
  Note:  Only the values with '(prefix)' are valid for the prefix evaluation.

                       [,<prefix>]]]]])
  
  The <string> argument handles the following syntax prefixes:
    " - This is a 'say' string.  If no prefix is specified this is the default
        case that is used.  When in 'say' format, it auto-closes all 
        double-quotes.
    : - This is a 'pose' string.  It follows standard pose/: syntax formatting.
    ; - This is the 'possessive-pose' string.  Follows ';' formatting.
    | - This is an '@emit' string.  Follow standard @emit formatting.
  
  If no prefix is identified as the 4 above, it assumes a say string.
  
  These prefixes are only used if the <prefix> option is specified in parsestr.
  If you do not specify a <prefix> then all prefix args are considered part
  of a normal string and ignored for special consideration.

& controls()
  Function: controls(<object>,<victim>)
 
  Returns 1 if <object> controls <victim>, 0 otherwise.

& map()
  Function: map([<obj>/]<attr>,<list>[[,<delim>][,<sep>][,<arg1>,...,<argN>])
  
  This function is nearly identical to an iter() operating on u() function.
  Each member of <list> is passed to the result of fetching <attr> as %0, and
  the results are used to form a new list, separated by the delimiter
  character.
  
  <delim>iter may be used to specify a delimiter other than space.
  
  <sep>erator may be used to specify an output seperator other than a space.
  
  You may specify arguments <arg1> through <argN> that will be passed as %1
  for the first argument (or arg1) all the way through MAX_ARGS 
  (which defaults to 30 total to a function, so 30 - 4 args, or 26 total).
  Any arguments over 9 can be fetched with v(10), v(11), etc.  You may also
  use the shift() function.
  
  Examples: 
  > &ADD_ONE object=add(%0,1)
  > say map(object/add_one,1 2 3 4 5)
  You say "2 3 4 5 6"
  
  See Also: filter(), fold(), iter(), parse(), u(), munge(), citer(), 
            nsiter(), sortlist()
  
& filter()
  Function: filter([<obj>/]<attr>,<list>[,<delim>[,<sep>][,<arg1>,...,<argN>]])
  
  This function evaluates the contents of <attr> for each element of <list>,
  passing it in as %0.  A <delimiter>-separated list is returned of those
  elements for which the evaluation returns the value 1.  You may specify an
  optional output seperator.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than space.
  
  You may specify 26 arguments to pass as %1 (or v(1)) though v(25) or may
  utilize the shift() function.
  
  Examples:
    > &IS_ODD object=mod(%0,2)
    > say filter(object/is_odd,1 2 3 4 5)
    You say "1 3 5"
    > say filter(object/is_odd,1@2@3@4@5,@)
    You say "1@3@5"
    > say filter(object/is_odd,1@2@3@4@5,@,|)
    You say "1|3|5"
  
  See Also: u(), map(), fold(), citer(), nsiter(), munge(), list(), sortlist()
  
& fold()
  Function: fold([<obj>/]<attr>, <list>[, <base-case>[, <delim>])
  
  This function iteratively processes a list through a function, feeding
  the result of one step into the next step as %0, passing in the next element
  from the list as %1.
  
  If a base case is provided, it is used as the initial %0.  If not, the first
  list element is passed as %0 and the second is passed as %1, and subsequent
  iterations proceed normally.
  
  <delimiter> may be used to specify a delimiter other than space, but you
  must specify a base case in order to specify the delimiter.
 
  Examples:
    > &REP_NUM object=[%0][repeat(%1,%1)]
    > say fold(object/rep_num,1 2 3 4 5,->)
    You say "->122333444455555"
    > &ADD_NUMS object=add(%0,%1)
    > say fold(object/add_nums,1 2 3 4 5)
    You say "15"

& RJ()
& RJUST()
  Function: rjust(<string>, <length>[, <fill>])
            rj(<string>, <length>[, <fill>])
 
  This function pads a string with leading <fill> characters, or with spaces
  if no fill character is given) ("right-justifies") so it is <length> long.
  If <string> is longer than <length>, the <string> is returned; it is not
  truncated. <fill> may be a string of over one character.
  
  If you wish to use ansified filler, use printf() instead.
   
  Examples:
    > say -[rjust(foo,6)]-
    You say "-   foo-"
    > say %r0[rjust(foo,6)]7%r01234567
    You say "
    0   foo7
    01234567"
    > say =[rjust(bar,5,.)]=
    You say "=..bar="
  
  Alternate:
    > say =[printf($:.:5s,bar)]=       (The default justification is right)
    You say "=..bar="
  
  See Also: rjc(), ljust(), ljc(), strlen(), printf(), wrap()
  
& RJC()
  Function: rjc(<string>, <length> [,<fill>])     'Right Justify and Cut'
   
  This function pads a string with leading blanks to right justify the 
  <string> within a field of <length> characters.  If <string> is longer 
  than <length> it will be cut to fit within a field of <length> characters.
  You may specify an optional fill character.
  
  If you wish to use ansified filler, use printf() instead.
   
  Examples:
    > say -[rjc(foo,6)]-
    You say "-   foo-"
    > say -[rjc(this is foo,6)]-
    You say "-this i-"
   
  See Also: rjust(), ljc(), ljust(), printf(), wrap()
 
& STRDISTANCE()
  Function: strdistance(<string1>, <string2> [,<type> [,<damareu match>]])
  
  This function will calculate the levenshtein distance between two strings.
  This basically is the value calculated by the number of letters that differ
  between the two strings entered.  If either string fed to this function
  is null, it returns a -1.  You may specify the <type> of '1' to expressly
  require case insensitivity in the matching.  The default behavior is case
  sensitivity.  The optional forth argument enables damareu style matching
  which considers the transposing of characters a single difference istead of
  two.
  
  Examples:
    > say [strdistance(this,thiz)]
    You say "1"
    > say [strdistance(this,This)]
    You say "1"
    > say [strdistance(this,This,1)]
    You say "0"
    > say [strdistance(the,teh)]
    You say "2"
    > say [strdistance(the,teh,,1)]
    You say "1"

& LJC()
  Function: ljc(<string>, <length> [,<fill>])     'Left Justify and Cut'
   
  This function pads a string with trailing blanks to left justify the 
  <string> within a field of <length> characters. If <string> is longer 
  than <length> it will be cut to fit within a field of <length> characters.
  You may specify an optional fill character.
  
  If you wish to use ansified filler, use printf() instead.
   
  Examples:
    > say -[ljc(foo,6)]-
    You say "-foo   -"
    > say -[ljc(this is foo,6)]-
    You say "-this i-"

& LJ()
& LJUST()
  Functions: ljust(<string>, <length>[, <fill>])
  Functions: lj(<string>, <length>[, <fill>])
 
  This function pads a string with trailing <fill> characters, or with spaces
  if no fill character is given) ("left-justifies") so it is <length> long.
  If <string> is longer than <length>, the <string> is returned; it is not
  truncated.  <fill> may be a string of more than one character.
  
  If you wish to use ansified filler, use printf() instead.
   
  Examples:
    > say -[ljust(foo,6)]-
    You say "-foo   -"
    > say %r0[ljust(foo,6)]7%r01234567
    You say "
    0foo   7
    01234567"
    > say =[ljust(bar,5,.)]=
    You say "=bar..="

    You say "=bar..="
  
  See Also: ljc(), rjust(), rjc(), strlen(), printf(), wrap()
  
& BITTYPE()
  Function: bittype(<object> [,<type>])
 
  Returns a number from the following table based on the owner of <object>.
  You may specify a <type> of '1' to enforce wiz-inheritance checks on
  the target <object> otherwise the default of '0' is applied which just
  checks ownership.
  
  The following permission levels are shown:
    God (#1)        7
    Super-Royalty   6
    Royalty         5
    Councilor       4
    Architect       3
    Guildmaster     2
    Citizen         1
    Wanderer/Guest  0
    ERROR           #-1
 
  If a player has more than one bit flag set, their highest one takes
  precedence.
 
& GLOBALROOM()
  Function: globalroom()
 
  Returns the dbnum of the global room to royalty and higher players.
  
  Example:
    > say globalroom()
    You say "#2"
 
& R()
  Function: r(<number>|<label>)
   
  The r() function is used to access "local registers", and returns
  the contents of the specified register. There are ten such registers,
  numbered 0 through 9.  The local registers are normally cleared at the
  start of each command, but are preserved across the commands that compose
  an actionlist, as well as commands that directly trigger actionlists, such
  as @switch, @trigger, and @dolist.  A macro for r() is also %q that some
  people prefer.  Example:  r(0) would be the same as %q0
  
  If enhanced setq has been enabled at compiletime, you may use a-z as well.
  Enabling this in the code can cause some excess memory usage.
  
  You may substitute <number> for <label> if you have one assigned for the
  register.  For %q to understand labels, you must use %q<label>.  The <>'s
  are required.
   
  Example:
    > say [setq(0,testing)][r(0)]
    You say "testing"
    > say [setq(0,testing,bob)][setq(bob,testing2)][r(bob)]
    You say "testing2"
    > say [setq(0,testing,bob)][setq(bob,testing2)]%q<bob>
    You say "testing2"
   
  See Also: setq(), setr(), nameq(), inc(), dec()
  
& XINC()
  Function: xinc(<number>)
  
  The xinc() function is used to increment the number passed into it.
  Any number passed into it is automatically incremented by one.
  
  Example:
    > say inc(5)
    You say "6"
    > say inc(-5)
    You say "-4"
  
  See Also: xdec(), inc(), dec(), add(), sub()
  
  Note:  Check @list options for the line 'Mux Formatted Inc() and Dec()'. If
         this is enabled, the functionality of inc() and dec() are swapped
         with xinc() and xdec() for MUX/Tiny style support.
  
& INC()
  Function: inc(<number>)
  
  The inc() function is used to increment numerical values in local registers.
  The valid registers are 0 through 9.  If the value in the register is a 
  string, it will return the string without any changes.
  
  Example:
    > say [setq(0,10)] 1: [r(0)] [inc(0)] 2: [r(0)]
    You say " 1: 10  2: 11"
    > say [setq(0,The)] 1: [r(0)] [inc(0)] 2: [r(0)]
    You say " 1: The #-1 GLOBAL REGISTER NOT AN INTEGER 2: The

  Note:  Check @list options for the line 'Mux Formatted Inc() and Dec()'. If
         this is enabled, the functionality of inc() and dec() are swapped
         with xinc() and xdec() for MUX/Tiny style support.
  
  
& XDEC()
  Function: xdec(<number>)
  
  The xdec() function is used to decrement the number passed into it.
  Any number passed into it is automatically decremented by one.
  
  Example:
    > say dec(5)
    You say "4"
    > say dec(-5)
    You say "-6"
  
  See Also: xinc(), inc(), dec(), add(), sub()
  
  Note:  Check @list options for the line 'Mux Formatted Inc() and Dec()'. If
         this is enabled, the functionality of inc() and dec() are swapped
         with xinc() and xdec() for MUX/Tiny style support.
  
& DEC()
  Function: dec(<number>)
  
  The dec() function is used to decrement numerical values in local registers.
  The valid registers are 0 through 9.  If the value in the register is a
  string, it will return the string without any changes.
  
  Example:
    > say [setq(0,10)] 1: [r(0)] [dec(0)] 2: [r(0)]
    You say " 1: 10  2: 11"
    > say [setq(0,The)] 1: [r(0)] [dec(0)] 2: [r(0)]
    You say " 1: The #-1 GLOBAL REGISTER NOT AN INTEGER 2: The
  
  See Also: inc(), setq(), setr(), r()
  
  Note:  Check @list options for the line 'Mux Formatted Inc() and Dec()'. If
         this is enabled, the functionality of inc() and dec() are swapped
         with xinc() and xdec() for MUX/Tiny style support.
  
& NAMEQ()
  Function: nameq(<register or label> [,<new label> [,<key>]])
  
  The nameq() function will label (or re-label) a setq register with the
  specified label.  You may use any name of 31 characters or less for
  the label.  You may use any character, including spaces.  The labels
  do not have to be unique, but be aware it will find the first match
  sequentially.  If you do not specify a new label, it will display
  the existing label (if one exists) for that register.
  
  If you specify a key of 1, <new label> MUST be null/empty, and this
  will return the register (0-9 or a-z) assigned to the specified label.
  
  Example:
    > say [setq(0,Test 1 2 3)][r(0)]
    You say "Test 1 2 3"
    > say [setq(0,Test 1 2 3)][nameq(0,Foo Foo)][r(Foo Foo)]
    You say "Test 1 2 3"
    > say [setq(0,Test 1 2 3)][nameq(0,Foo Foo)][nameq(0)]
    You say "Foo Foo"
    > say [setq(0,Test 1 2 3)][nameq(0,Foo Foo)][nameq(Foo Foo,,1)]
    You say "0"
  
  See Also: setq(), setr(), r(), SETQ_TEMPLATE

& SETQ()
  Function: setq(<number>,<string>[,<label>])
            setq(<label>,<string>[,<label>)
            setq(!,<string>,<label>)
            setq(+,<string>,<label>)
 
  The setq() function is used to copy strings into local registers.
  It returns a null string; it is a purely "side effect" function.
  
  There are ten local registers, numbered 0 through 9. They are cleared
  at the start of each command. They are most useful for storing complex
  function evaluations which are used repeatedly within a single command.
  The local registers may be read via the r() function, and a common use
  of setq()/r() is to temporarily store the result of a complex evaluation
  whose result is needed more than once.
 
  setq() can be used to improve the readability of MUSH code, as well as to
  cut down the amount of time needed to do complex evaluations.
  
  If enhanced setq has been enabled at compiletime, you may use a-z as well.
  Enabling this in the code can cause some excess memory usage.
  
  Compiletime may also switch this functionality with SETQ_OLD().  Check
  @list options to see if it was.
  
  You may specify an optional label to assign the register to later call
  with r().  Labels can contain any character and must be 31 chars or less.
  You may then specify the label instead of the <number>.  Using '!' for the
  number/label specifies to reuse the label OR assign a label to the next
  available register automatically.  '+' will use the first  unnamed AND
  unused register.  '!' just uses the first unnamed register.
  
  If the label is 0-9 or a-z when using '+' or '!' it assumes you want the
  register set and not a label assigned.
   
  Example:
    > &TEST me=Test on [mudname()] at [time()].

& SETQ_OLD()
  Function: setq_old(<number>,<string>[,<label>])

            setq_old(!,<string>,<label>)
            setq_old(+,<string>,<label>)
  
  This functions exactly like setq(), except it is using the old MUSH 
  method of evaluation.  This tends to be less abraisive on braces and
  brackets.
  
  Please check @list options to see if SETQ_OLD and SETQ are switched
  at compiletime.
  
  You may specify an optional label to assign the register to later call
  with r().  Labels can contain any character and must be 31 chars or less.
  You may then specify the label instead of the <number>.  Using '!' for the
  number/label specifies to reuse the label OR assign a label to the next
  available register automatically.  '+' will use the first unnamed AND
  unused register.  '!' just uses the first unnamed register.
  
  If the label is 0-9 or a-z when using '+' or '!' it assumes you want the
  register set and not a label assigned.

            setr(!,<string>,<label>)
            setr(+,<string>,<label>)
 
  The setr() function is used to copy strings into local registers.
  Unlike setq(), it returns its <string> argument.
  In all other respects it is identical to setq().
  
  If enhanced setq has been enabled at compiletime, you may use a-z as well.
  Enabling this in the code can cause some excess memory usage.
  
  Compiletime may also switch this functionality with SETR_OLD().  Check
  @list options to see if it was.

& TRIM()
  Function: trim(<string> [,<trim style> [,<trim character(s)>]])
 
  This function will trim trailing and/or lead characters on the string
  that you specify.  <trim character> specifies the character to trim (default
  is space), and <trim style> tells the kind of trimming to perform (default
  is trim both sides of the string).  You may specify more than one character
  for trimming.
 
  The following values for <trim style> are recognized:
      'b' :   Trim both ends of the string (default)
      'l' :   Trim the left end of the string.
      'r' :   Trim the right end of the string.
  Note: anything else specified for <trim style> will trim both sides.
 
  Example:
    > say trim(;;;Wacka;;;,,;)
    You say "Wacka"
    > say trim(%b%b%b Polly Parrot %b%b%b%b,r)
    You say "    Polly Parrot"
    > say trim(---Trim Rules!---,l,-)
    You say "Trim Rules!---"
  
  See Also: center(), ljust(), rjust(), ljc(), rjc(), s(), printf()
  
& CENTER()
  Function: center(<string>,<width>[,<fill>])
 
  This function will center a string in a string <width> characters wide,
  using <fil> characters for padding on either end of the string for
  centering.  If no fill character is specified then a space is used.
  If <string> is longer than <width> characters, the string is returned
  unmodified.  The <fill> may contain more than one character.
  
  If you wish to use ansified filler, use printf() instead.
   
  Example:
    > say center(a,5,-)
    You say "--a--"
    > say center(*BAMF*,15)
    You say "    *BAMF*     "
  
  Alternate:
    > say printf($:-:^5s,a)            (the '^' specifies center justify)
    You say "--a--"
  
  See Also: ljust(), rjust(), ljc(), rjc(), printf()
  
& INSERT()
  Function: insert(<list>, <pos> [<pos2>...<posN>], <word>[, <sep>])
   
  This function inserts a word into <list> so that the word becomes the
  <pos>'th element of the list, and all subsequent list elements are moved
  down.  This means that it appears between the <pos-1>'th and <pos>'th
  elements of the original list.  This function may be used to append or
  prepend a word to a list.  You may specify more than one position.
   
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  The <pos> fields may be negative to take the argument from the right
  instead of the left.
   
  Examples:
    > say insert(This is a test, 4, new)
    You say "This is a new test"
    > say insert(Yet@Another@List, 3, Funky, @)
    You say "Yet@Another@Funky@List"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), ldelete(), replace(), iindex(), aindex(),
            rindex()
  
& LREPLACE()
  Function: lreplace(<list>, <pos>, <string>[, <delim>])
  
  This function replaces the words in the list <list> starting at the
  position <pos> and continuing to overwrite word for word till the
  end of <string>.  If <string> is longer than what would be replaced,
  the rest of the <string> is automatically appended to the end of
  <list>.  You may specify optional delimiters instead of the default
  space.  You may specify more than one position.
  
  Examples:
    > say lreplace(this is a test,3,a spotted giraffe)
    You say "this is a spotted giraffe"
    > say lreplace(this@is@a@test,2,was@another,@)
    You say "this@was@another@test"
  
  See Also: replace(), rindex(), ldelete(), ldelete(), delete()
  
& REPLACE()
  Function: replace(<list>, <pos> [<pos2>...<posN>], <word>[, <delim>])
   
  This function inserts a word into <list> so that the word becomes the
  <pos>'th element of the list, and the word previously in that position
  is removed.  This means that it appears between the <pos-1>'th and
  <pos+1>'th elements of the original list, replacing the word at that
  position.  This function may not be used to append a word to a list.
  You may specify more than one position.
   
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  The <pos> fields may be negative to take the argument from the right
  instead of the left.
   
  Examples:
    > say replace(This is a test, 4, quiz)
    You say "This is a quiz"
    > say replace(Yet@Another@Mundane@List, 3, Funky, @)
    You say "Yet@Another@Funky@List"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), insert(), ldelete(), delete(), rindex()
  
& LDELETE()
  Function: ldelete(<list>, <pos> [<pos2>...<posN>] [, <sep>])
 
  This function removes a word from <list> by position.
  
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
  
  The <pos> fields may be negative to take the argument from the right
  instead of the left.
   
  Examples:
    > say ldelete(This is not a test, 3)
    You say "This is a test"
    > say ldelete(Yet@Another@Mundane@List, 3, @)
    You say "Yet@Another@List"
  
  See Also: extract(), extractword(), insert(), replace(), rindex()
  
& ISALPHA()
  Function: isalpha(<string>)

    You say "1"
   
  See Also: hasflag()
  
& ISINT()
  function: isint(<string>)
  
  This function matches the returned string to see if it is a valid
  integer.  A valid integer is considered a string that optionally
  starts with a + or a - and contains nothing but numbers.

            isword()
  
& ISSPACE()
  Function: isspace(<string>)
 
  This function matches on the FIRST CHARACTER of the string and checks
  if it's a white-space character (returns, spaces, tabs, etc).  If it
  is, it returns a '1', else it returns a '0'.
  
  Examples:
    > say isspace(space(5))

  This function will return 1 if the string passed to it is a valid dbref.
  To be a valid dbref the string must begin with '#' and be followed by an
  integer.  Also, the dbref must exist in the current database as a valid
  object.  If the object fails either of these criteria, then a 0 is
  returned.
 
  Example:
     > say isdbref(#-1)
     You say "0"
     > say isdbref(#1)

  This function will return '1' if the argument is a valid word.  A valid word
  is defined as a string that is totally alpha or contains a hyphen (-) char.
  
  Example:
    > say isword(testing)
    You say "1"
    > say isword(testing0)
    You say "0"

& ANSI()
  Function: ansi(<codes>,<string>[,<codes>,<string>,...,<codes>,<string>])
            ansi(FG/BG,<string>[,<codes>,string>,...,FG/BG,<string>])
   
  *NOTE* : You MUST have both the ANSI and ANSICOLOR flags set to see color!
           ANSI-NORMAL (n) has priority in any ansi string!
  
  This allows you to highlight a string using ANSI terminal effects. The
  string is terminated with a "return to normal" code, and the codes are
  utilized in the order they are specified. You may specify multiple
  arguments as shown to ansi().  The 16 color codes are:
   
    f - flash                           i - inverse
    h - hilite                          n - normal
    u - underscore
   
    x - black foreground                X - black background
    r - red foreground                  R - red background
    g - green foreground                G - green background
    y - yellow foreground               Y - yellow background
    b - blue foreground                 B - blue background
    m - magenta foreground              M - magenta background
    c - cyan foreground                 C - cyan background
    w - white foreground                W - white background
  
  For example, "ansi(fc, Test)" would hilight "Test" in flashing cyan.

  Function: ansi(<codes>,<string>)   -- CONTINUED
            ansi(<FG>/<BG>,<string>) -- CONTINUED
  
  For 256 color support, we offer multiple methods to handle it.  This needs
  the XTERMCOLOR flag to be set in addition to the normal ANSI and ANSICOLOR.
  
  First, you may specify the color with the + prefix.  This does not require 
  the '/' in the second option unless you intend to use background  colors.
  
  For 256 Color support we offer for the <FG> and <BG> options:
    0x<hex>     -- example: ansi(0xC4/,string) for 256 color foreground support
                            ansi(/0xC4,string) for 256 color background support
                            ansi(0xC4/0xC1,string) for FG and BG support
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    0-255       -- example: ansi(196/,string) instead of '0xC4' for decimal.
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    +color      -- example: ansi(+pink,string) for the 256 foreground 'pink'.
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    #FFFFFF     -- example: ansi(#FF0000,string) to specify the RGB values.
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    <#FFFFFF>   -- example: ansi(<#FF0000>,string) to specify the RGB values.
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    <R G B>     -- example: ansi(<255 0 0>,string) to specify the RGB values.
                   This does NOT require / for FG colors, but does for BG.
    /           -- foreground/background indicator -- required where mentioned.
   
  You may mix and match the methods of the 256 color support.  As ansi() 
  supports multiple arguments, you may also use multiple types in different
  arguments.
  
  You may also use the %c/%x substitution (depending what is configured) to
  display 256 colors by using the '0x##' for foreground and '0X##' for 
  background.  Example: %c0xc4%c0X20whee%cn.  This allows you to even mix
  and match different ansi types like: %c0xc4%c0X20%cuwhee%cn to underline.
  0x## is foreground, and 0X## is background when using percent substitutions.

  You may also use the XTERM color support if your client supports it.
  You must set the XTERMCOLOR flag to see the extended color set.
  
  See XTERMCOLOR LIST for the extended color list and codes used for it.
  
  hex like ansi(0xca/0xab,string).  ansi(+colorname/+colorname) is allowed 
  for foreground and background.  Hex is case-insensitive.
  
  There is also a substitution for colors.  This is '%c' and works just
  as '%n' would for your name.  %crred%cn is red, %c0x01red%cn is also red.
  If you use %c substitutions, the 'x' after the '0' IS CASE SENSITIVE.  
  0x01 would be foreground, 0X01 would be background.
  
  Examples: 
    > say I like %cbblue %cnrocks and %crred %cnballs
    You say "I like <blue> rocks and <red> balls"
    > say I like [ansi(b,blue)] rocks and [ansi(r,red)] balls
    You say "I like <blue> rocks and <red> balls"
    > say I like [ansi(38/,skyblue)] rocks and [ansi(203/,indianred)] balls
    You say "I like <skyblue> rocks and <indianred> balls"
    > say I like [ansi(0x26/,skyblue)] [ansi(0xcB/,indianred)] ballons
    You say "I like <skyblue> <indianred> balls"
    > say I like [ansi(+skyblue,skyblue)] [ansi(+indianred,indianred)] balls
    You say "I like <skyblue> <indianred> balls" (note / not needed for +FG)
    > say I like [ansi(+skyblue/,skyblue)] [ansi(+indianred/,indianred)] balls
    You say "I like <skyblue> <indianred> balls"
  
  The words 'blue' and 'red' being their respected colors.  Any ansi
  sequence can be substituted using percent substitutions, and will
  continue till either the end of the line or until a normalization ansi 
  code is entered (the %cn).

  NOTE:  The ANSI flag is used to see base ansi sequences (flash,highlight,etc)
         The ANSICOLOR flag is used _with_ ANSI to see color.
         The XTERMCOLOR flag is used _with_ ANSICOLOR to see extended colors.
         You must have both of the first flags set to see ansi color.
         You must have all three flags to see extended colors.

  Ansi, since all special characters (including those accented!) are passed 
  around the parser as % codes (%c/%x/%f), and the parser USES %'s and \'s 
  as escape codes, this means that when you try to ansi backslashes (\) or 
  percents (%) the parser and ansi-translater could misinterprete your 
  intention as escaping out that ansi and not actually mean colorize my 
  escape character. 
  
  Don't worry!  Not all is lost!  You may specify the percent(%) character 
  as chr(37) and the backslash(\) as chr(92) and these will be passed 
  through the parser as 'special' substitutions, meaning once it hits the 
  ansi-translater, you get to see your percent and/or backslash in the nice 
  pretty color you wanted.  The percent and backslash issue usually only 
  happens when it's at the very end of the string you are trying to colorize 
  or accent.  
  
  Also, any use of chr() will padd out any alignment by 5 characters.  So any
  that you use, make sure to keep this in mind.  All the formatting functions
  take this into account automatically so should be invisible to you, but
  the overhead does exist.
  
  Examples:
    > say ansi(hr,\\)
    You say "\%cn"                             (the \%cn is highlight red)
    > say ansi(hr,chr(92))
    You say "\"                                (the \ is highlight red)
    > say ansi(hr,%%)
    You say "%cn"                              (the %cn is highlight red)
    > say ansi(hr,chr(37))                     
    You say "%"                                (the % is highlight red)

            SUBSTITUTIONS, XTERMCOLOR LIST, COLORS()

& STRIPANSI()
  Function: stripansi(<string>)
  
  Returns the string with all ansi codes removed.
  
  Example:
    > say stripansi(ansi(hr,red))
    You say "red"
  
  See Also: NO_FLASH, ANSI, ANSICOLOR, stripaccents()
  
& CLUSTER_ADD()
  Function: cluster_add(<cluster>, <object>)
  
  This function adds the target object into the cluster specified.
  
  This is a sideeffect function.
  
  Example:
    > say cluster_add(#1234,#9876)
    Cluster object #9876 has been added to #1234

            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(),

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_ATTRCNT()
  Function: cluster_attrcnt(<object> [,<key>])
  
  This function returns the total attributes in the given cluster.
  
  The following keys exist:
      0 - (default) - list attributes and delete corrupted attributes.
      1 - list attributes and attempt to repair corrupted attributes.
      2 - list attributes but do not touch corrupted attributes.
      3 - remove any IS_LOCK on any attribute that is user-defined.
  
  If there is attribute corruption, the value returned will be '-1'.
  
  Examples:
    > say cluster_attrcnt(cluster#1)
    You say "20192"
    > say words(cluster_lattr(cluster#1))	(this will hit the LBUF limit)
    You say "622"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(),

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_DEFAULT()
  Function: cluster_default(<obj>/<attr>,<default case>)
   
  This function returns the value of <obj>/<attr>, as if retrieved via
  the cluster_get() function, if the attribute exists and is readable by you.
  This works like the normal default() function but is geared to clusters.
  
  Examples:
    > >TEST cluster#1=apple orange banana
    > say cluster_default(cluster#1/Test, No fruits!)
    You say "apple orange banana"
    > >TEST cluster#1
    > say cluster_default(cluster#1/Test, No fruits!)
    You say "No fruits!"

            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_EDEFAULT()
  Function: cluster_edefault(<obj>/<attr>,<default case>)
 
  This function returns the evaluated value of <obj>/<attr> for the cluster,
  as if retrieved via the cluster_get_eval() function, if the attribute 
  exists and is readable by you. Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, 
  and returns that. The default case is only evaluated if the attribute
  does not exist or cannot be read.
 
  Example:
    > &TEST cluster#1=You have lost [rand(10)] marbles.
    > say cluster_edefault(cluster#1/Test,You have no marbles.)
    You say "You have lost 6 marbles."
    > &TEST me
    > say cluster_edefault(cluster#1/Test,You have no marbles.)
    You say "You have no marbles."

            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(),

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_FLAGS()
  Function: cluster_flags(<object>[/<attribute>])
  
  This function gets the flags of the specified cluster object, or if specified
  the attribute in the cluster.
  
  Example:
    > say cluster_flags(cluster#1)
    You say "is"
    > say cluster_flags(cluster#1/myattrib)
    You say "p"
    > say cluster_flags(me/asdfadsfasdfaf)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(),

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()
  
& CLUSTER_GET()
  Function: cluster_get(<object>/<attribute>)
 
  The get function fetches the specified attribute from the cluster object.
  It can be used to get attributes from objects you own, public and visual
  attributes of objects near you, and public and visual attributes other
  than the description of players wherever they may be.  If the attribute is
  not present on cluster <object>, it will continue through every object
  in the cluster.
 
  Example:
    > read me
    > say get(cluster#1/desc)
  
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_GET_EVAL()
  Function: cluster_get_eval(<object>/<attribute>)
 
  The get_eval function returns the specified attribute from the named cluster
  (just like the get function), except that function references and
  %-substitutions have already been performed.  In function references, 
  'me' refers to the object being looked at, and %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, etc) refer to the object making the get_eval
  call.  If the attribute is not present on <object>, it searches all clusters
  for the attribute.
 
  Example:
    > @va cluster#1 = This is a get_eval test on %n.  The vb is [get(me/vb)]
    > @vb cluster#1 = VB from test
    > say cluster_get(cluster#1/va)
    You say "This is a get_eval test on %n. The vb is [get(me/vb)]"
    > say cluster_get_eval(cluster#1/va)
    You say "This is a get_eval test on Foobar. The vb is VB from test"

            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_GREP()
  Function: cluster_grep(<object>, <attribute(s)>, <pattern>[,<type> [,<key>]])
   
  This returns a list of any matching attribute in a cluster that matches the
  <attribute(s)> that contain <pattern>.  The <attribute> may be wildcarded
  with a '*' or a '?' for multiple character matches and single character
  matches respectively.  In addition, the pattern may also be wildcarded.
  The following types exist:
    0 - show attributes matching pattern (default)
    1 - show the dbref# then all matching attributes after it
    2 - show the attributes in the form dbref#/pattern
  
  You may specify 'key' to '1' to remove assumed wildcard matches and require
  literal wildcard placements.
   
  Examples:
    > @va cluster#1=This is a test
    > @vb cluster#2=This is another test.
    > @vc cluster#3=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say cluster_grep(cluster#1,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB VC"
    > say cluster_grep(cluster#1,v*,is,,1)
    You say "VA VB"
    > say cluster_grep(cluster#2,v*,*is*)
    You say "VA VB VC"

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_HASATTR()
  Function: cluster_hasattr(<object>/<attribute name>)
            cluster_hasattr(<object>,<attribute name>)
  
  This function checks if the cluster has the matched attribute.  It will 
  search every object in the cluster for the matching attribute returning a
  1 (true) if it exists or a 0 (false) if it does not.
  
  Examples:
    > say cluster_hasattr(cluster#1,desc)
    You say "1"
    > say cluster_hasattr(cluster#1,rubberbabybuggybumper)
    You say "0"

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_HASFLAG()
  Function: cluster_hasflag(<object>[/<attrib>], <flag>)
  
  This function returns a '1' if the flag exists in the cluster, a '0' if it
  does not.  You may specify an attribute for the cluster for the flag match.
  If specifying a cluster object, it chooses the cluster object you specified.
     
  Example:
    > say cluster_hasflag(cluster#1, wizard)
    You say "0"
    > say cluster_hasflag(cluster#1, safe) 
    You say "1"
    > say cluster_hasflag(cluster#1/desc, NOPROG)
    You say "1"

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_LATTR()
  Function: cluster_lattr(<obj>[/<wild>][,<tgt>[,<tp>][,<flg>][,<rexp>][,<tr>])
 
  Returns a list of the attributes set on cluster <obj>ect.  If <wild>pattern
  is given, only attributes matching it are returned.  If you have the regexp
  toggle <rexp> as true (1), the matching <wild> is evaluated as a regular
  expression instead of the default matching algorithem.  You may specify the 
  optional target <tgt> if you wish to return attributes that only the target
  could see.  If you do not have control over target, it defaults to yours.
  This searches all objects that are contained in the cluster.
  You may specify tree <tr> viewing if you set it to '1'.
  
  You may specify a type <tp> to check against.  The following types exist:
    + - List existing lock attributes on player.
    $ - list all attributes that are $commands.
    ^ - list all attributes that are ^listens.
    & - list all attributes that contain all attribute flags <flg>.
    | - list all attributes that contain any attribute flags <flg>.
    l - list total attributes and pages of attributes.
    # - page (1, 2, etc) for attribute listing.  118 for 32byte attrs.
    > - find the alphanumerical largest attribute name.
    < - find the alphanumerical smallest attribute name.
    ~ - [~#1-#2] list attribs starting at #1 until count of #2.

& CLUSTER_LATTR2   
  CONTINUED
  Function: cluster_lattr(<obj>[/<wild>][,<tgt>[,<tp>][,<flg>][,<rexp>][,<tr>])
  
  Example:

& CLUSTER_REGREP()
  Function: cluster_regrep(<object>, <attrs>, <regexp> [,<key>])
  
  This function returns a list of attributes on cluster <object> containing
  <pattern> (or matching <regexp>).  <attrs> is a wildcard pattern for
  attribute names to search; if you want to search all attributes, use "*".
  
  Parsing _does_ occur before this function is invoked. Therefore,
  "special" characters will need to be escaped out.   This searches all
  objects contained in the specified cluster.
  
  If <key> is specified as '1', attribute wildcards are done with
  regular expression matching.  The default is globbing (* and ?).
  
  This function is case-sensitive. 
  
  Examples:
    > @va cluster#1=This is a test
    > @vb cluster#2=This is another test.
    > @vc cluster#3=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say cluster_regrep(cluster#1,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB"

            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_REGREPI()
  Function: cluster_regrepi(<object>, <attrs>, <regexp> [,<key>])
  
  This function returns a list of attributes on cluster <object> containing
  <pattern> (or matching <regexp>).  <attrs> is a wildcard pattern for
  attribute names to search; if you want to search all attributes, use "*".
  
  Parsing _does_ occur before this function is invoked. Therefore,
  "special" characters will need to be escaped out.  This searches all
  objects contained in the cluster.
  
  If <key> is specified as '1', attribute wildcards are done with
  regular expression matching.  The default is globbing (* and ?).
  
  This function is case-insensitive.
  
  Examples:
    > @va cluster#1=This is a test
    > @vb cluster#2=This is another test.
    > @vc cluster#3=Test Test Test whisooo!
    > say regrepi(cluster#1,v*,is)
    You say "VA VB"

& CLUSTER_SET()
  Function: cluster_set(<object>,<[!]<flag> [[!]<flag> [!]<flag> ...]>)
            cluster_set(<object>,<<attribute>:<value>>)
            cluster_set(<object>,<<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>>)
            cluster_set(<object>/<attr>,[!]<attrflag>)
  
  The cluster_set() function is a side-effect for the @cluster/set command.  
  Everything that worked with @cluster/set will work with cluster_set().  It 
  follows the same permissions and restrictions of the command.  The SIDEFX 
  flag is required to use cluster_set().  For flags, this will set the flags 
  on ALL objects in the cluster.
  
  Type @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  
  Example:
  > @cluster/set cluster#1=safe
  Cluster: Flags (safe) set on cluster members #3672 #3667 #3683
  > say cluster_set(me,safe)
  You say ""

& CLUSTER_STATS()
  Function: cluster_stats(<object>,<type> [,<attribute name>])
  
  This function returns various statistics for the cluster specified.  The 
  following <type> is available for the cluster:
      0 - return 1 if specified object is a cluster, 0 if not (default).
      1 - return the list of objects contained in the specified cluster.
      2 - return the action list for the specified cluster.
      3 - return the threshold value for the specified cluster.
      4 - return dbref# where the attribute name exists in the specified 
          cluster.  Third option must be used for this option.
  
  Examples:
    > &FOOBAR #234=Boo
    Set.
    > say [cluster_stats(cluster#1,0)] | [cluster_stats(cluster#1,1)]
    You say "1 | #123 #234 #345"
    > say cluster_stats(cluster#1,2)
    You say "@pemit owner(me)=Cluster exceeded!"
    > say cluster_stats(cluster#1,3)
    You say "700"
    > say cluster_stats(cluster#1,4,foobar)
    You say "#234"

            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_U()
  Function: cluster_u([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
   
  The cluster_u function evaluates an attribute, either from the object 
  performing the function or from another object you own, passing in arguments
  and returning the result.  It searches the entire cluster for the matching 
  attribute.
  
  See '@list options' to see if this functionality switched with u2()'.
  This will be switched if 'u() TinyMUSH compatibility' is enabled.
   
  Examples:
    > @va cluster#1=Word is [extract(cluster_get(me/vb),add(%0,1),1)], arg2:%1.
    > @vb cluster#2=This is a test of the u function.
    > say cluster_u(cluster#3/va,4,Testing 123)
    You say "Word is of, arg2:Testing 123."

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_U2()
  Function: cluster_u2([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
  
  This is nearly exactly like the original cluster_u() function except it 
  parses in an object-dependant way like the old mushes.  It works by 
  evaluating the function(s) by the power of the owner of the item it's 
  on, and not by the power of the enactor.  
  
  This command is also very handy to keep security.
  
  See '@list options' to see if this functionality switched with cluster_u2()'.
  This will be switched if 'u() TinyMUSH compatibility' is enabled.
   
  For examples or more information, look at cluster_u()
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(),

            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_U2DEFAULT()
  Function:  cluster_u2default([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
   
  Works like cluster_udefault() but uses the u2() function instead of u()
  
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the cluster_u2() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
   
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
 
  Examples:
    > &TEST cluster#1=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say cluster_u2default(cluster#1/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_U2LDEFAULT()
  Function:  cluster_u2ldefault([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
   
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the cluster_u2local() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.
   
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  Unlike cluster_u2default(), it doesn't clobber
  %q0-%q9 registers.
   
  Examples:
    > &TEST cluster#1=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say cluster_u2ldefault(cluster#1/Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_U2LOCAL()
  Function:  cluster_u2local([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
 
  The cluster_u2local() function is almost identical to u2() in function:  it
  evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the function,
  or another object that you control or has the same owner as you, passing
  in arguments and returning the result. When evaluating the fetched
  attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and not the 'calling' object;
  'me' refers to the object that supplied the attribute.
 
  However, unlike the u2() function, the global registers r(0) through r(9)
  (%q0 - %q9) are preserved in their initial state. This means that functions
  "below" the level of the u2() can reset global registers for temporary
  calculations, without needing to worry about "clobbering" the original
  values.
 
  This makes cluster_u2local() particularly useful for global or shared code 
  which calls arbitrary u2() functions, where global register values need to be
  preserved from accidental user clobbering.
  
  This function searches all objects in the cluster for the matching attribute.
   
{ See "help cluster_u2local2" for examples. }
 
& CLUSTER_U2LOCAL2
  Example of cluster_u2local():
    > &FRUIT cluster#1=apples bananas oranges pears
    > &SUB-FUNCTION cluster#2=[setq(0,v(FRUIT))][extract(%q0,match(%q0,%0),1)]
    > &TOP-FUNCTION cluster#3=[setq(0,are delicious!)]
                              [cluster_u2local(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say cluster_u2(cluster#1/TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas are delicious!"
   
  If SUB-FUNCTION had been called with cluster_u2() and not cluster_u2local():
    > &TOP-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,are yummy!)][cluster_u2(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say cluster_u2(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas apples bananas oranges pears"
   
  In this second example, in SUB-FUNCTION, %q0 was set to "apples bananas
  oranges pears", so that when the cluster_u2() "returned" and TOP-FUNCTION 
  evaluated %q0, this is what was printed. In the first example, 
  cluster_u2local() reset the value of %q0 to its original "are delicious!"
 
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_UDEFAULT()
  Function:  cluster_udefault([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
 
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the cluster_u() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.  This searches all objects in the cluster.
   
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.
   
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say cluster_udefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_UEVAL()
  Function: cluster_ueval([<obj>/]<attr>/permission[,<arg>],...)
  
  The cluster_ueval function evaluates an attribute, either from the object 
  performing the function or from another object you own, passing in 
  arguments and returning the result.  In this way it works just like 
  'cluster_u()', except you pass in a permission to specify what permission 
  level you wish to use for evaluation.  
   
  The available permission levels are CIT[IZEN], GUILD[MASTER], ARCH[ITECT],
  COUN[CILOR], ROY[ALTY], IMM[ORTAL].  You must have the permissions of the
  given level in order to use it else it defaults to your permission level.
  The permission must be included for the function to work.
  
  Examples:
    > @set cluster#1=royalty (let's assume you're a wizard)
    > @va cluster#1=[num(*Miriar)] (the ghod character - #1)
    > say cluster_ueval(va/royalty)
    You say "#1"

            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_ULDEFAULT()
  Function:  cluster_uldefault([<obj>/]<attr>,<default case>[,<arg>]...)
   
  This function returns the value of the user-defined function
  as defined by <attr> (or <obj>/<attr>), as if retrieved via
  the cluster_u() function, with <args>, if the attribute exists and is
  readable by you.  This searches all objects in the cluster.
   
  Otherwise, it evaluates the default case, and returns that. The
  default case is only evaluated if the attribute does not exist
  or cannot be read.  %q registers are not clobbered with this function
  unlike the cluster_udefault().
   
  Examples:
    > &TEST me=[center(%0,5,*)]
    > say cluster_uldefault(Test,-- BOOM --,ACK)
    You say "*ACK*"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_ULOCAL()
  Function:  cluster_ulocal([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
   
  The cluster_ulocal() function is almost identical to u() in function:  it
  evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the function,
  or another object that you control or has the same owner as you, passing
  in arguments and returning the result. When evaluating the fetched
  attribute, %# refers to the original enactor and not the 'calling' object;
  'me' refers to the object that supplied the attribute.
   
  However, unlike the cluster_u() function, the global registers r(0) through 
  r(9) (%q0 - %q9) are preserved in their initial state. This means that 
  functions "below" the level of the u() can reset global registers for 
  temporary calculations, without needing to worry about "clobbering" the 
  original values.
   
  This makes cluster_ulocal() particularly useful for global or shared code 
  which calls arbitrary cluster_u() functions, where global register values 
  need to be preserved from accidental user clobbering.
   
{ See "help cluster_ulocal2" for examples. }
 
& CLUSTER_ULOCAL2
  Example of cluster_ulocal():
    > &FRUIT cluster#1=apples bananas oranges pears
    > &SUB-FUNCTION cluster#2=[setq(0,v(FRUIT))][extract(%q0,match(%q0,%0),1)]
    > &TOP-FUNCTION cluster#3=[setq(0,are delicious!)]
                              [cluster_ulocal(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say cluster_u(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas are delicious!"
   
  If SUB-FUNCTION had been called with cluster_u() instead of cluster_ulocal():
    > &TOP-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,are delicious!)][cluster_u(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
    > say cluster_u(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
    You say "bananas apples bananas oranges pears"
   
  In this second example, in SUB-FUNCTION, %q0 was set to "apples bananas
  oranges pears", so that when the cluster_u() "returned" and TOP-FUNCTION 
  evaluated %q0, this is what was printed. In the first example, ulocal() 
  reset the value of %q0 to its original "are delicious!"
   
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(),

            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_VATTRCNT()
  Function: cluster_vattrcnt(<object>)
  This function counts just the user-defined attributes that exist on
  a cluster.  User defined attributes are attributes that are set
  with the &attr object=string or @set object=attr:string commands and
  have no @<attribute> ability. (like @va, @desc, etc)
  
  To set attributes on clusters, you would use >attr object=string or
  @cluster/set cluster=attr:string.
  
  Examples:
    > say vattrcnt(cluster#1)
    You say "714"
    > say cluster_vattrcnt(cluster#1)
    You say "7123"
    > say cluster_attrcnt(cluster#1)
    You say "9175
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(), 
            cluster_hasattr(), cluster_lattr(), cluster_regrep(), 
            cluster_regrepi(), cluster_set(), cluster_stats(), cluster_u(), 
            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()

& CLUSTER_WIPE()
  Function: cluster_wipe(<object>[/wildattr] [,<regxp>])
  
  The cluster_wipe() function will remove all matching attributes 
  specified by a wildcard, or, if no attribute is specified, 
  remove all attributes of the specified cluster.  This function 
  works like @cluster/wipe and follows all permissions and 
  restrictions of the matching command.
  
  If <regexp> is specified as '1', then <wildattr> is evaluated as a
  regular expresion instead of the default expresion.
  
  Check @list options to see if this side-effect is enabled.
  Anything using this side-effect must have the SIDEFX flag set.
  
  Examples:
    > say cluster_wipe(#123)
    You say ""
    > say cluster_wipe(#123/*foo*)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),
            cluster_get(), cluster_get_eval(), cluster_grep(),

            cluster_u2(), cluster_u2default(), cluster_u2ldefault(), 
            cluster_u2local(), cluster_udefault(), cluster_ueval(), 
            cluster_uldefault(), cluster_ulocal(), cluster_vattrcnt(), 
            cluster_wipe(), cluster_xget(), iscluster(), cluster_flags(), 
            cluster_hasflag(), cluster_add()
  
& CLUSTER_XGET()
  Function: cluster_xget(<object>,<attribute>)
   
  The xget function fetches the specified attribute from the named object.
  It can be used to get attributes from objects you own, public and visual
  attributes of objects near you, and public and visual attributes other
  than the description of players wherever they may be.  If the attribute is
  not present on <object>, its parent is searched for the attribute.
  This searches all objects in the specified cluster.
   
  Example:
    > read cluster#1
    > say cluster_xget(cluster#1,desc)
    You say "My Desc"
  
  See Also: @cluster, cluster_attrcnt(), cluster_default(), cluster_edefault(),

  The folder command allows you to work with mail folders.  For further
  information on mail, see 'help mail'.  For general information about mail
  folders, see 'help mail folders'.
   
  The folder command takes various switches to perform the various folder
  sub-commands, as in: 
     folder/create
   
  To get help on a particular folder sub-command, enter:
     help folder <sub-command>
  
  To get a list of all commands and a short syntax and description, enter:

  'HELP MAIL MAIN' for main index.    'HELP MAIL TOPICS' for topical help.
  
  If you are used to the MUX standard of @mail or the softcoded BrandyMail
  you will want to use the BRANDY_MAIL toggle.  
  
  If you are used to the PENN standard of @mail, you will want to use
  the PENN_MAIL toggle.  The BRANDY_MAIL toggle will take presidence.
  
  For using the line editor, you may use the MAIL_STRIPRETURN toggle.  This
  will convert the carrage return between lines to a space when combining.
   
  To set a toggle, you would type: @toggle me=<toggle>.  An example would be:
                        @toggle me=BRANDY_MAIL
 
  Examples:
    > mail me=My Subject//My Body
    Mail: You have new mail from -> <your name>
    Mail: Message sent to -> <your name>

& MAILFILTER
  Attribute: &MAILFILTER
  
  This attribute, when set on a player, will allow that player individual
  control of where the mail will go.  This allows the player to redirect
  incoming mail into pre-existing folders.  The following are passed:
              %0  - the dbref# of the player (or #-1 if anonymous)
              %1  - the subject of the message
              %2  - the body of the message
              %3  - the date/time of the message
  Examples:
    > folder/list
      Mail: You have the following folders ->
      Incoming Testing Junk
    > &MAILFILTER me=[switch(%0,#123,Testing,#234,Junk)]
      Set.
    > think [num(me)] [name(me)]
      #123 Yourself
    > mail me=A Test//A Test
      Mail: You have new mail from -> Yourself [Subj: A Test]
      Mail: Auto-Moved to folder -> Testing
      Mail: Message sent to -> Yourself
    > (recieving mail from Bob, dbref #999)
      Mail: You have new mail from -> Bob [Subj: Hey!]
    > (recieving mail from Tony, dbref #234)
      Mail: You have new mail from -> Tony [Subj: You smell]
      Mail: Auto-Moved to folder -> Junk
  
  See Also: @mailsig
 
& mail-filtering
  You can specify mail filtering by using the MAILFILTER attribute.  This
  allows you filter incoming mail by either the target player or the subject.
  If the mail was sent anonymously, the player is returned as #-1, otherwise
  the dbref# of the player will be returned.
  
  For detailed help, see help for MAILFILTER

& mail-aliases
  There are multiple ways to have aliases in RhostMUSH.  The standard method
  is for global mail aliases.  Only wizards may set, modify, or remove global
  mail aliases.  You may see global mail aliases by typing:
  
                               mail/alias
  
  This command will show all the global mail alises, if it's a static mail
  alias or a dynamic mail alias, or if there's any locks that make it so
  you can not use them.  To use a static mail alias, you would prepend a '+'
  before the alias.  Such as:
  
                               mail +wizards=To all Wizards!
  
  For dynamic mail aliases, you would prepend a '$' before the alias.
  
                               mail $wizards=To all Wizards!
  
  You will see with mail/alias if it's a static global (+) or a dynamic
  global ($) mail alias to help avoid confusion.
  
  {see 'help mail-aliases2' for personal mail aliases}
  
& mail-aliases2
  There is a third method for aliases.  These are considered personal mail
  aliases, and anyone may set them.  To set them, you just store an attribute
  on yourself containing a list of players.  This field can not be evaluated.
  An example of a personal mail alias would be:
  
                               &myfriends me=Bob Sarah #456 Julie
                               @set me=myfriends:Bob Sarah #456 Julie
  
  Either sets an alias for Bob, Sarah, player #456, and Julie.  Any non-players
  will automatically be stripped in the sending of the mail (with appropiate
  warning messages).  To use a personal alias, you would use the key field
  '&' to identify to the mail system that it is a personal mail alias.
  
                               mail &myfriends=To all of my friends!
  
  For help on setting attributes, please check help for '&' or '@set'.

& mail technical
  Topic: technical information about the mail system
  
  The mail system was designed years ago and has gone through modifications
  which help compress it's mail storage architecture.  Some of the technical
  information to the mail system is:
  - Multiple sent mail shares a single message for compactability
  - Mail system uses a separate database separate from the MUSH db.
  - Mail system is totally hard-code.  No dependancy on mush version or objs.
  - Folder system is stored along with the mail db separate from the mush db.
  - Mail database can be dumped on-line for cross-platform backups/recovers.
  - Mail database can be loaded on-line (it *will* delete current mail db)
  - Mail system does not suffer corruption and other instabilities that
    softcoded mailers of similar functionality have. (Example: brandy mailer)
  - Allows some user-configurability for ease of use (to be expanded later)
  - Has full featured database recovery suite and index rebuilding incase of
    corruption by some remote off-chance.

  mail/check <player>=<arg>  - This checks the target player's mail allowing
                               you to read it.  That player MUST have their

& mail changes
  Topic: changes
  
  There are some changes that you may notice with the new mail system.  These
  changes are the following:
  
    Subjects are included with mail:
        - Subjects are added by separating the body and the subject using 
          '//'.  IE: mail user=subject//body 
          (see: help mail send)
        - Subjects can be added with the mail's line editor.  This is done
          by using the +subject option.  IE: mail/write +subject
          (see: help mail write)
  
    Recalling mail has been greatly modified:
        - You are able to recall any message not read by another player that
          you have sent.  It is displayed in a concise manner.
          (see: help mail recall)
  
{ type: help mail changes2 to continue }
  
& mail changes2
  Topic: changes (continued)
  
    New options for mail/write:
        - When adding new text, you can use the shortcut of '-' to add new
          lines.  This works similar to MUX's @mail does.
          (see: help mail write)
  
    New options for locking mail:
        - You can set a reject message for people you lock your mail out to.
          (see: help mail reject)
   
    Mail signatures:
        - Mail signatures that are automatically included are set by using
          @mailsig attribute.  To set, just type: @mailsig me=<signature>

& mail setup_aliases
  Command:  1. mail/alias  
            2. wmail/alias[</switches>] [<alias-name>=<list of players>]
            3. &ATTRIB me=<list of players> 
            4. &ATTRIB me=<eval returning list of players>
            5. &ALIAS.NAME <mail_def_object>=<eval returning list of players>
            6. &COMMENT.NAME <mail_def_object>=<label description for alias>
  
  There are various types of aliases you can set up.  Below will be described
  each alias and how to set up each kind and use them.
 
  * Global Aliases
    Global aliases can only be created by a wizard.  You can see what global
    aliases exist with 'mail/alias'.  To use a global alias, you would use
    the '+' prefix.  To create global aliases as a wizard, 
    you use the 'wmail/alias' command.
    Example:  mail +wizards=Hi!
    1.  Option '1' above is how you would see all the current global aliases.
    2.  Option '2' above is how a wizard would set a STATIC global alias.
  
  * Personal Aliases
    Personal aliases are actually nothing more than attributes you store on
    yourself.  If you have friends called 'bob' 'terry' and 'james' you would
    set can set the alias like this:  &friends me=bob terry james
    To use the personal STATIC alias, you would use the '&' prefix.
    To use the personal DYNAMIC (eval) alias, you would use the '~' prefix.
    3.  Option '3' above sets a static list of dbref#'s (or player names)
        that will be used as a personal alias you can then use in sending 
        mail with '&'.
        Example: &FRIENDS me=Moe Larry Curley Shemp Joe
                 mail &friends=Hi!
    4.  Option '4' works similar to option 3, except it is a function
        evaluation that then returns a list of player names or dbref#'s to
        use in a mail.  You  may also specify another target other than
        yourself.
        Example: &EVAL_FRIENDS MyObject=[get(Stooges/player_list)]
                 mail ~MyObject/eval_friends=Hi!
   
  * Global Evaluated Aliases
    Evaluated aliases are similiar to static aliases.  When a wizard sets
    these up, they work by evaluation so can be used to set up global
    dynamic aliases.  These are referenced with a '$' prefix.
    This requires that the @admin config parameter 'mail_def_object' is
    defined.
    5.  Option '5' above sets the actual evaluated alias.
    6.  Option '6' just sets a label/description that is shown when a player
        lists the aliases.
        Example:  mail $wizards=Hi!
    
  See Also: help mail send 
  
& mail signature
  Command: &MAILSIG me=<string>
   
  mail signatures are done by storing a user-defined attribute on yourself.
  the attribute is called 'MAILSIG'.  To set this attribute, you would do:
      &MAILSIG me=whatever you want as your signature.
  
  Please keep in mind that this attribute is *NOT* evaluated for functions and
  is taken as-is.
  
& mail version
  Command: mail/version
  
  this command will show the current version of the mailsystem.
  
& mail reject
  Command: mail/reject <msg>
           mail/reject +list
           mail/reject
  
  Will set the message sent when a player attempts to send a mail message to 
  someone who has that player locked from mailing them.  This works similar
  to the @reject for pages.  To see the current reject message use the 
  +list option.  To clear the message, do mail/reject without a message.
  Use the /lock switch to mail to establish a mail lock.
   
  Examples:
    > mail/reject I don't want you to mail me anymore.  Nayh!
    > mail/reject
    > mail/reject +list
  
  See Also: mail lock
  
& mail lineeditor
  Topic: mail line editing
    
  The mailsystem has a built-in line editor for sending all forms of mail.  
  This includes forwarded mail, replied-to mail, and standard mail and mass 
  mail. To look at sending mail by using a line by line input, check the help 
  for:
  
     mail write   (IE: help mail write)
  
  See Also: mail write, mail send, mail line
  
& mail autopurges
  Topic: mail autopurging 
  
  The mail system has a built in autopurging system.  To save mail
  from autopurging, it needs to have the SAVE flag set on it.  You
  have a limited number of SAVE flags you can set.  For help on
  the save flag for mail, do 'help mail save'.  Autopurging is
  currently set to three weeks but can be set at any time.  NEW
  and UNREAD mail is not effected.  
  
  Wizards by default are never auto-purged from.
  
  To set the save flag, you would use:
  
     mail/mark/save <arg>
  
  where <arg> is a single message, a list of messages, or a combination.
  
  Note:  By default, players are given 10 save slots for messages.
         This can be increased globally or individually on a case by case
         basis.  Please see 'mail/quota' to see what your current saved
         quota is.

& mail credits
  Topic: mail credits
  
  This mail system was coded by Seawolf.  It is largely based on 
  Ashen-Shugar's mush-coded +mail system.
 
  Help files were written by Wizard@ApexMUSH, Seawolf, and Ashen-Shugar.
 
  Thanks to Lothar for suggesting folder/share.
  
  Thanks to beta-testers:
    Ashen-Shugar, Eingelbert, Seth, Wizard
  
& mail list_aliases
  Topic: mail aliases
  
  There are two distinctive types of mail aliases.  The first is the
  user defined alias.  To set this, you would set an attribute on
  yourself with the names and/or numbers of the people in the list
  you want to send to.
  
  Example: &FRIENDS me=Nyctasia Seawolf billie sappho
           &EVAL_FRIENDS me=[v(myfriends_list)]
  
  You would use this by inputting on the 'send' option of mail
  the following:
  
  Example: mail[/send] &friends=Hello my friends!
           mail[/send] ~me/eval_friends=Hello my friends! 
  
  As shown, the /send parameter is optional for sending mail.
  
  The second form of aliases are global aliases.  These are 
  established by the administration for the use of everyone on the 
  system.  You would use this by inputting on the 'send' option
  of mail the following: 
  (Let's assume a global alias of 'members')
  (Let's assume a dynamic eval list of 'wizards' for wizards)
  
  
  Example: mail[/send] +members=Welcome fellow guild members!
           mail[/send] $wizards=Welcome eval-wizard list members!
  
  As above, the /send parameter is optional.

  To mark a message for deletion:
     mail/mark #                        (help mail mark)
     For example:   mail/mark 12
  
  To save a message (keep it from being purged):
     mail/mark/save #                   (help mail save)
     For example:   mail/mark/save 12
 
  To delete marked messages:
     mail/delete                        (help mail delete)
  
  To get a quick summary of mail (how many new, unread, old, marked, 
  current folder):
     mail[/quick]                       (help mail quick)
     Note that 'quick' is optional for this command (mail/quick).
  
  To see all mail headers and status:
     mail/status                        (help mail status)

& mail quota
  Command:  mail/quota

  Check how many mail messages are in your mailbox, as well as the maximum
  amount of mail messages you are allowed to store in your mailbox.  It
  will also display the total number of saved messages you are allowed
  and the total number of saved messages you currently have used.
  
  See Also: quick, status
  Wizards: wizhelp wmail size
  
& mail autofor
  Command: mail/autofor <player-name>
           mail/autofor +off
  
  Autoforwarding is used to autoforward mail that you would normally get
  to another player character.  This is handy in the event that you have
  multiple characters and wish to have mail all catagorized to a central
  character.  All forwarded mail is sent as from the original sender, 
  not from the player it was forwarded from.
  
  Autoforwarding can only be forwarded on a one-time basis.  It is not
  recursive.  So in otherwords, you can not forward mail forwarded to you.
  
  To remove an autoforwarding use the command:
      mail/autofor +off
  
  Mail that is autoforwarded will show up to the user sending you mail
  where it got autoforwarded to.
  
  See Also: mail lock, mail share
  
& mail save
  Command: mail/mark/save <range>
           mail/unmark <range> (notice, you do not use /save with this)
  
  The save switch is used in junction with the MARK switch.  When used,
  this will mark a mail message as SAVED and any autodeletion will
  not remove the mail.  Please note that there is a maximum number of
  saved messages available that you can use and once reached, you are
  unable to save new ones w/o removing one of your prior ones.  To
  unmark the message you may either use mail/mark (without a save)
  or mail/unmark.  Saved mail shows up with a 'S' by the flag.
  
  See Also: mail mark
  
& mail alias
  Command: mail/alias
  
  The alias switch is used to display any global alias you have 
  permission to access and will list all players that are attached
  to that global alias.  Global aliases are maintained by the 
  administration of the mush.  If you have ideas of global aliases,
  suggest it to them and they will add them.
  
  Syntax: mail/alias
  Wizards: wizhelp wmail alias
  
& mail anonymous
  Command: mail/anon player=message
           mail/anon/send player=message
           mail/anon/forward <msg#> player=message
           mail/anon/reply <msg#>=message
  
  The anon[ymous] switch is used in junction with the /send, /forward, or
  /reply switches (or normal sending) to ANONYMOUSLY send the mail message
  to the player.  Wizards are except from receiving anonymous mail due to
  security issues.
  
  Attempting to forward anonymous mail shows the original message being
  'anonymous'.  Attempting to reply to an anonymous mail will reply 
  to the 'anonymous' player, while that player still receives the message.
  
  If you use the line editor, you can use -~ to send anonymously instead of
  -- which would normally send the mail.
   
  See Also: mail send, mail reply, mail forward
  
& mail massmail
  Topic: mail mass mailing
  
  Massmailing is done by using the optional /SEND feature of the mail
  system.  The syntax is as follows:
  
  mail[/send] usr1 usr2 .. +<gls> $<gev> &<pls> ~<eval> = [subject//]message
  
    <gls>  -- represents a global alias seen with mail/alias
    <gev>  -- represents a global evaluated alias seen with mail/alias
    <pls>  -- represents an attribute on yourself containing a list of players
    <eval> -- represents a [<obj>/]<attr> to eval like get_eval()
  
  To display to all people in the mail who the message was sent to, add
  a @ before the first name.  For example:
  
     mail @user1 user2 ... userx=message
  
  The subject, which is optional can be added before the message and 
  separated with two /'s.  For example:
  
     mail user=This is my subject//This is the mail I want to send you.
  
  See Also: mail send forward, mail send reply, mail send
  
& mail previous
  Command:  mail/next -
  
  Yes, you put a hyphen after the next.  This will in effect view the 
  previous mail message from the one you last read.  For example, if
  you typed:
       mail 5
  
  You would read mail message #5 (if you had mail)
  
  If you typed:
       mail/next -
  
  You would read mail message #4
  
  See Also: mail next, mail zap
  
& mail next
  Command:  mail/next
  
  This option will automatically view the next mail message from the one
  you last read.  For example, if you typed:
    mail 1 
  
  you would read mail message #1 (if you had mail)
  If you typed:
    mail/next
  
  you would read mail message #2 (if you had that number of messages)
  
  Note:  If you add a '-' after next (i.e. mail/next -) it will read the
         previous message.
  
  See Also: mail status, mail zap, mail read
  
& mail zap
  Command:  mail/zap
  
  This option will automatically mark the present message and view the 
  next message.  For example, if you typed:
    mail 1
  
  you would read mail message #1 (if you had mail)
  If you typed:
    mail/zap
  
  You would mark message #1 for deletion and read message #2
  (if you had two messages, in which it would only mark #1 and return
   that you had no more mail to read)
  
  Note:  If you add a '-' after zap (i.e. mail/zap -) it will read the
         previous message.

& mail send
  Topic: mail sending
  
  There are three ways that you can send mail with the mail system.  Depending 
  on which way you prefer, this will point you to the correct help files.
  
  1.  Brandy/Mux style mail.  This is when you do 'mail user-list=subject'
      Look at  :  'help mail send brandy' and 'help mail write cmdlist'
      Needed   :  The BRANDY_MAIL toggle (help brandy_mail) 
                  **NOTE**: @toggle me=brandy_mail to set it.
      Syntax   :  mail user(s)=subject
                  mail/reply <msg#>=subject
                  mail/forward <msg#> <user(s)>=subject
      Note:  Brandy/MUX mail wrappers may be in place on your RhostMUSH.
             If it is, you may be able to use @mail like you're used to.
  
  2.  PennMUSH style mail.  This is used for the PennMUSH style mailing.
      Needed   : The BRANDY_MAIL toggle must be UNSET and PENN_MAIL toggle
                 must be set.  BRANDY_MAIL has precidence.
      Syntax   : mail user(s)=subject/body
      Note:  Penn mail wrappers may be in place on your RhostMUSH.  If it is,
             you may be able to use @mail like you're used to.

  3.  RhostMUSH line editor.  This is when you do 'mail/write <start of text>'
      Look at  :  'help mail write' and 'help mail write cmdlist'
      Syntax   :  mail/write Start Of Message
  
  4.  Mailing quickly.  This is when you do 'mail <user-list>=<subj>//<body>'
      Look at  :  'help mail send quick' and 'help mail cmdlist'
      Needed   :  The BRANDY_MAIL toggle must NOT be set. 
                **NOTE**: @toggle me=!brandy_mail to remove it.
      Syntax   :  mail user(s)=Optional Subject//Body
                  mail user(s)=Body
  
  Please check @list options to see what current global settings are enabled
  for the mail system.  Start a sendlist with a , for player's with spaces.
  
  See Also: PENN_MAIL, BRANDY_MAIL, mail write, mail send quick, 
              mail send brandy
  
& mail send brandy
  Topic: brandy +mail system
  
  The brandy mailer 'syntax' uses the mail/write (or -) operation for adding
  new lines.  Please refer to 'HELP MAIL WRITE CMDLIST' for a list of commands
  available for writing using the line editor.
  
  You may use, for ONLY this syntax, '--' to send the mail off.  
  If you choose to use mail/write +send=<player-list>, it will override the
  player list you specified originally.
   
  You need the BRANDY_MAIL toggle (@toggle me=brandy_mail) to use this syntax.
  
  You may also optionally set the MAIL_STRIPRETURN toggle to signal the mailer
  to use spaces to seperate lines instead of a carrage return.
   
  This effects the commands:  mail, mail/reply, and mail/forward.
  
  Please note that mail/send will send a mail message 'quickly' and bypass
  the line editor.  You may use mail/send to send a message WHILE WRITING
  another message with the line editor.
     
  See Also: BRANDY_MAIL, mail write, mail send quick, mail send brandy
  
& mail send quick
  Command:  mail/send [@]<address list>=[<subject>//]<message>
  The address list can contain any number of recipients (up to the mush
  buffer limit) and can be one of the following:
      A player name  
      A player number prefixed by a dbrief# 
      A mail alias attribute located on the player prefixed by a & 
         (this is just an attribute on yourself with a list of players)
      A global mail alias attribute prefixed by a +. 
      A mail alias attribute location on optional target prefixed by a
         ~ character.  This is evaluated like get_eval().
  
  The different elements in the address list need to be separated by spaces. 
  If you include the optional '@', all recipients of a mail message will 
  see the complete list of recipients. (This will show up as a 'CC' list).
  To give an optional subject, enter text you want as a subject then 
  separate that from the rest of the message with two /'s. (IE: // )
     
  There is an exception to the '@'.  Check @list options, if the To: is
  automatically added, the '@' character's behavior is reversed.
  
  You can break up mail with either spaces OR commas and duplicates are
  automatically stripped out.
  
{ help mail send2 for more, or help mail send examples for examples }
& mail send2
  Command: mail/send (CONTINUED)
  
  To use the alias "&alias", you would need an attribute on yourself
  called "alias".  There are no restrictions on the name of the alias,
  except that if the alias doesn't exist on the player calling the
  command or is a bad mush attribute name, the mailer will not accept
  it.  The attribute referenced by the &<alias> is another address
  list, and can also contain other aliases if desired.  Any recursion
  will stop when the mush long_buffer length is reached.  You may also
  use '~' to evaluate the attribute.
  
  Examples: 
    > &FRIENDS me=Seawolf Ashen-Shugar Thorin
    > mail &friends=Hiya!
    > &ONLINE me=[lwho()]
    > mail ~online=hiya!
  
  To use the global alias '+alias', there would have to be a pre-defined
  global attribute defined.  If the global attribute does not exist,
  the input is ignored as an illegal entry.  To have a global alias
  set, notify the nearest royalty or higher of what you wish to use.  The 
  address list can be separated by either spaces or commas.
  
  Examples: 
    > mail/alias
      Alias: wiz
      Contents: Wizard AdminJudge SlothTheWiz
    > mail +wiz=hello!
  
  This would send to the players 'Wizard, AdminJudge, and SlothTheWiz'  
  
  For examples, see: mail send examples
  
& mail send examples
  Command: mail/send
  
  Examples:
    > mail player=how are you?
    > mail myfriend myotherfriend +social &friendlist=Party!!
    > mail/send player=My Subject//My Text I want to send you.
    > mail/send myfriend=Hi.  Meet me tomorrow at the club.
    > mail/send tinypal #12345=Are you coming to the party?
    > mail/send &allfriends=Come to my club for a party tonight. 
    > mail/send ~evaledattr=Where do you want to meet?
    > mail/send +social=Where do you want to meet for the next party?
    > mail/send @myfriend tinypal otherfriend +social=Let's go to the party!
    > mail/send player1 player2 ... playerX=hi!
    > mail/send player1,this is player2,player3,...,playerX=hi!
  
  For those with limited number of input lines, an alternative
  method for writing mail exists.  For information on this,
  read the help files for 'mail write'.  The /SEND switch for mail is
  optional.
  
  See Also: mail write, mail forward, mail reply, mail recall
  
& mail reply
  Command: mail/reply [@|^]<msg #>[*]=[<subject>//]<message>.

  Reply to a mail message with your own message.  The @, ^, and * are optional
  to preface or follow the message number.  You can only reply to messages in
  the current folder.  You may also specify an optional subject.
  
  To reply to all recipients of the mail message, in addition to the sender:
     -preface the message number with @ for all recipients of your reply to
      appear in the 'To' line.
     -preface the message number with ^ for all recipients to see only their
      own name in the 'To' line (i.e. not see who else received the reply).
      This is the default.
  
  To include the original message in your reply:
     -follow the message number with *.
  
  Examples:
    > mail/reply 2=Sure, I'll come to the party.  
    > mail/reply 1*=What did you mean?
    > mail/reply @12=Why don't we all get together tomorrow?
    > mail/reply ^9*=I'm not sure if we should build that.
  
  Note:  If you are @toggled BRANDY_MAIL, instead of <message> it would be your
         subject.  Then you'd use '-' for additional text and '--' to send.
  
  See Also: mail forward, mail send
  
& mail forward
  Command: mail/forward <msg #> [@|^]<list> [=[<subject>//]<additional text>]
  
  Forward a mail message to someone.  Note that you do not have to include your
  own message, which is appended to the bottom of the message.  The
  message number and the address list are separated by a space.  For the
  format of the address list, see the help on the send sub-command
  (help mail send).  You can only forward messages in the current folder.
  
  Examples:
    > mail/forward 3 myfriend
    > mail/forward 2 &friendlist=Weird!!!//What do you think of this?
    > mail/forward 12 @friend1 #12345 friend2=Can you believe this?!
  
  Note:  If you have the BRANDY_MAIL @toggle set, the syntax would be this:
    > mail/forward 3 myfriend
    > mail/forward 2 &friendlist=My Subject
    > mail/forward 12 @friend1 #12345 friend2=This is a subject
  
  You'd then use '-' for additional text and '--' to send the mail.
  
  See Also: mail reply, mail send
  
& mail read
  Command: mail[/read] <msg #|new|unread>
  
  Read a mail message.  You can specify the message number, or to read the 
  first new or unread mail message.  Check help on the status sub-command 
  (wizhelp mail status)for information on how to see mail headers.  The /READ
  switch is optional.  Optional arguments to 'mail/read' is as follows:
      mail[/read] new    - read first new message
      mail[/read] nall   - read ALL new messages
      mail[/read] unread - read first unread message
      mail[/read] uall   - read ALL unread messages
      mail[/read] ball   - read ALL new AND unread messages
      mail[/read] #      - read specified mail message number
 
  Examples:
    > mail/read 2
    > mail 10
    > mail/read new
    > mail new
    > mail/read unread
    > mail unread
  
  See Also: mail status, mail delete, mail mark, mail next, mail zap,
            mail unmark, mail save, mail new, mail unread, mail nall, 
            mail ball, mail uall
  
& mail lock
  Command: mail/lock <key>
  
  You can lock your mailbox so that only certain people can (or cannot)
  send you mail.  The key is the same as for any other lock.  Type:
  
                       'help @lock keys' 
  
  for a list of the keys you may use.  To unlock, use a
  blank key.  IE: mail/lock  (this will unlock your mail lock)
  
  Examples:
    > mail/lock tinyspouse  (this locks to just tinyspouse)
    > mail/lock !tinyjerk   (this locks against tinyjerk)
    > mail/lock             (this removes your mail lock)
   
  The attribute it sets on you is 'MailLock' and is set like a normal lock.
   
  See Also: mail reject, mail recall
  
& mail status
  Command: mail/status [[p#] [*player] [#-#] [U/N/B/O/M/S] [/SUBJECT]]
  
  This will print out a list of the message headers in the current
  folder for which the player has mail.  This will also show the current
  folder.  The p# argument (where # is an integer) will print out the
  specified page of message headers if the user has his/her paging value
  set.  The page is determined from the paging value entered with the
  page command which represents the number of messages on a page.  If
  the user has no paging value set, entering a page number on this
  command will have no effect.  If the user has a paging value set and
  enters 0 for the page number, the user will get all message headers
  without any page breaks.  
  
  Check out help on 'mail page' to see how to set your paging value.  
  The '*player' option will show all mail sent to you from the given player, 
  and the #-# is a range of messages you would like to see.  The letters 
  U, N, B, O, M, and S are the special character representations for:
     (U)nread             (N)ew                    (B)oth new and unread
     (O)ld                (M)arked (for deletion)  (S)aved
  
  The /SUBJECT option will do a search for mail matching '/SUBJECT' in the
  subject field.  The string after the '/' tells what to search for.
  
{ To continue with examples, see 'help mail status2' }
  
& mail status2
  Command: mail/status (continued)
  
  Mail status looks like the following:
    > mail/status
    ...
    [N] ( 5)  From: Wizard <Sat Nov 5 14:00:05 1994> (113 bytes)
    [R] ( 6) *From: Seawolf <Fri Nov 4 12:23:02 1994> (200 bytes) Fwd
              Subj: In Reply to your mail.
    ...
  
  The letter in brackets indicates the status (old, new, unread, marked, saved)
  The corresponding letter will show what it is (O, N, U, M, S). The
  number following the status indicates the message number.  The status also
  reports who sent the mail, when the mail was sent, and the size of the 
  message.  It also will show if the mail was forwarded, or replied to and any
  optional subjects that were included on the mail message.  New mail becomes 
  unread if you logout without reading it.  The '*' shows the player connected.
  Examples:
    > mail/status          (shows all your mail in your current folder)
    > mail/status p2       (shows second page of your mail [if page is set])
    > mail/status 10-50    (shows messages 10-50 in your mailbox)
    > mail/status 5        (shows just message 5 in your mailbox)
    > mail/status *Seawolf (shows all mail from player Seawolf)
    > mail/status U        (shows all the unread mail in your mailbox)
    > mail/status B        (shows all the unread and new mail in your mailbox)
    > mail/status /biff    (shows mail with subjects containing the word biff)
  
  See Also: mail number, mail read, mail mark, mail unmark, mail save, 
            mail page
  
& mail delete
  Command: mail/delete
  
  This command will delete all your marked messages in all your folders.
  
  See Also: mark, unmark, recall, save
  
& mail recall
  Command: mail/recall [ <#>|+all|*<player> [=<player>|+all] ]
           mail/recall <various options>
  
  This command will let you recall (IE: delete) unread, unmarked
  messages that you have sent to other players.  It allows you
  you to either list all messages that you have sent that you can currently
  recall, view a specified message that you sent that can be recalled,
  and optionally recall from a single or multiple users or recall all messages.
  
  To view all messages that you can recall:
    mail/recall
  
  This will display something like this:
    Msg #:   1       To: Seawolf Wizard
    Msg #:   8       To: Wizard George Freddie
    Msg #:  10       To: TwinkMan
    Mail: Done
  
  This will show mail you have sent that can still be recalled.  The Msg# may 
  skip numbers if those messages have been previously read and can no longer 
  be recalled.  *NOTE* You may specify a player with '*playername' to limit
  the search on both 'mail/recall' and 'mail/recall/all'.
  
{ To continue [with examples], please type: help mail recall2 }

& mail recall2
  Command: mail/recall (continued)
  
  To check a message that you can possibly recall, type in:
    mail/recall # (IE: mail/recall 1)
  
  This will display something like this:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Recall #: 1
    To: Seawolf Wizard
    Date/Time: Mon Nov 1 04:08:32 1992         Size: 233 Bytes
    Subject: Hey!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <the message that you sent them>
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mail: Done
   
  If you wish to recall this message from the user, Wizard, you would type:
    mail/recall 1=wizard
  
  If you wish to recall this message from everyone, you would type:
    mail/recall 1=+all
  
  if you want to recall all messages you have sent to everyone, you would type:
    mail/recall +all
  
  This will tell you how many messages were successfully recalled. 
  
{ type help mail recall3 to continue }
  
& mail recall3
  Command: mail/recall (continued)
  
  To check all messages that you have sent (but not necessarily recall) use:
    mail/recall/all
  
  You may specify a search by player with the /recall switch with or without
  the /all switch.  Such would be like:
    mail/recall *TinyPlayer
    mail/recall/all *TinyPlayer
  
  The display will display all messages that you have sent.  The only 
  difference will be that some of the messages (probably most of them) you 
  will be unable to recall.  The other functions (like viewing message and who
  it was sent to) should still work.
  
  See Also: mail save, mail send, mail mark, mail unmark
  
& mail mark
  Command: mail/mark <#>|all|<*player>
  
  This command allows you to mark messages for deletion.  <#> indicates
  a specific message to be marked.  To delete more than one message by
  message number, separate the message numbers by spaces.  Specify "all"
  to mark all messages.  Specify a person by name or db reference # to
  mark all messages from that player.  You can only mark messages in the
  current folder.
  
  You would add /save as a switch to mark a message for being saved instead
  of marking it for deletion.  See 'help mail save' for more.
    
  Examples:
    > mail/mark 1        (mark message 1 for deletion)
    > mail/mark 1 5 8    (mark messages 1, 5, and 8 for deletion)
    > mail/mark all      (mark all your messages for deletion)
    > mail/mark *tinypal (mark messages from player 'tinypal' for deletion)
    > mail/mark #12345   (mark messages from player #12345 for deletion)
    > mail/mark 1-5 8 9  (mark messages 1 through 5, 8, and 9 for deletion)
   
  See Also: mail unmark, mail delete, mail status, mail save
  
& mail unmark
  Command: mail/unmark <#>|all   (this works for saved messages as well)
  
  This command is similar to mark except that it unmarks messages.  You
  may use mark and unmark to mark all but specific messages.  You can only
  unmark messages in the current folder.  You would use this to unmark SAVED
  messages as well.
  
  Examples:
    > mail/mark all
    > mail/unmark tinyspouse  (These two commands in this order mark
                               all but tinyspouse's messages.)
    > mail/mark tinypal
    > mail/unmark 2 5         (These two commands in this order mark all
                               of tinypal's messages, except messages 2 and 5).
    > mail/unmark 1-5         (unmark messages 1 through 5) 
  
  See Also: mail mark, mail delete, mail status, mail save
  
& mail number
  Command: mail/number <target>=# 
   
  This command is similar to the status command.  If someone has set up 
  his mailbox to be shared with you, you can use this command to see the 
  status of the target's mailbox.
   
  As with the status command, the # here is optional.  If it is given
  (in this case the second argument), it will have the same effect as it
  would on the status command.
   
  Examples:
    > mail/number tinyspouse  (list all of tinyspouses mail [if you pass lock])
    > mail/number tinypal=2   (list just message 2 of tinyspouses mail)
   
  See Also: mail status, mail check, mail page, mail share
  
& mail check
  Command: mail/check <target>=<#>
  
  If someone has set up her mailbox to be shared with you, you can use this
  command to read a particular message from the target's mailbox.
   
  Example:
    > mail/check tinyfriend=4    (read tinyfriend's message #4)
   
  See Also: mail read, mail number, mail share
  
& mail password
  Command: mail/password +set=<password>
           mail/password <password>    
           mail/password +set         
  
  The first version of the password sub-command sets your password for
  mail access.  Once you set your password, you must use the second form
  of the password sub-command every time you connect to this mud in
  order to access your mail.  Note that you only have to enter your mail
  password once per login session.  If you have not set a mail password, you
  do not need to enter a password at all to access your mail.
   
  To clear the password, use the +set format with a blank password.
  Your mail password is separate from your login password.
  
  Examples:
    > mail/password +set=appleorange    (set mail password)
    > mail/password appleorrange        (enter password to access mail)
    > mail/password +set                (remove password)
  
  See Also: mail share, mail lock, mail autofor
  
& mail share
  Command: mail/share <key>
  
  Share lets you give access to your mailbox for other players who pass
  the lock.  The key is a standard boolean lock expression, as documented
  in 'help @lock keys'.
   
  Any player who passes the lock may do the /number and /check
  sub-commands on your mailbox. If you do not have a share lock set on
  your mail, this is the same as if nobody can pass the share lock. To
  clear the lock, enter a blank expression.
   
  If you set a folder/share, players who pass the mail/share lock can
  only see the folder you specify.
   
  Examples:
    > mail/share *tinyspouse             (allows tinyspouse into your mail)
    > mail/share *tinyspouse | *tinypal  (allows tinyspouse and tinypal)
    > mail/share                         (removes the sharelock)
  
  The attribute is 'ShareLock' on yourself.

& mail write +cc
  Command: mail/write +cc=<player-list>
  
  The '+cc' subcommand is used to replace (not modify!) the target list of
  players the mail is going out to.  Keep in mind, this ONLY works for
  sending or forwarding.  This does *NOT* work for replies.
  
  This only works when you are @toggled BRANDY_MAIL and when you
  start a message with 'mail player-list=subject' (or similiar).
  
  Example:
    > mail/write +cc=player1 player2 &myalias +globalalias ~evalalias
    Mail: New send player list stored.
  
  See Also: mail write +bcc, mail write +acc
  
& mail write +bcc

  and blind target list of players the mail is going out to.  Keep 
  in mind, this ONLY works for sending or forwarding.  This does 
  *NOT* work for replies.  If 'bcc_hidden' is ENABLED, then 
  whoever is in the +bcc list will _NOT_ see who the mail was sent
  to.  If 'bcc_hidden' is DISABLED, then whoever is in the +bcc
  list WILL see who the mail was sent to, but no one outside the
  +bcc list will.  In effect, bcc_hidden toggles the effect.
  
  Please check '@list options mail' for the current configuration.
  
  You may specify '!ALL' to clear the Bcc list without effecting
  the To list.
  
  This only works when you are @toggled BRANDY_MAIL and when you
  start a message with 'mail player-list=subject' (or similiar).

  sending or forwarding.  This does *NOT* work for replies.
  
  This only works when you are @toggled BRANDY_MAIL and when you
  start a message with 'mail player-list=subject' (or similiar).

& mail write -
  Command: mail/write <text>
           -<text>
  
  The '-' subcommand is used to continue lines of text after the initial
  'mail/write' was used to start the mail message.  This is used in
  juncture with sending, forwarding, or replying to mail using the
  line editor.  This command will NOT be recognized as a valid command
  if you did not use mail/write previous to it!
  
  Example:
    > -this is a line of text
    Huh?  (Type 'help' for help.)
    > mail/write I forgot to start the message first!
    Mail: Write message started (37/32758).

& mail write quicksending
  Topic: mail write quicksending
  
  To send mail quickly, you can use the default behavior of mail.  The
  syntax for a quick message is as follows:
  
    mail/send [@] <player-list> = [optional subject//] Message Body
  
  This fires off the mail without initiating the line editor.
  
  The /send switch is optional, unless you are toggled BRANDY_MAIL, in
  which case, the /send switch is required.
  
  Yes, you can use a quick message to send a mail message while in the
  middle of a line editor in writing a different mail message.
   
  See Also: mail send, mail
  
& mail write adding
  Topic: mail write adding text
  
  There are two ways to write mail using the mail/write method.  You can
  use mail/write to save text, or, after using mail/write for the first
  line (to initialize the mail message being written) you may use a '-'
  to continue writing lines of text.
  
    mail/write (used to initialize mail writing and write first line)
    -          (can be used instead of mail/write to write additional lines)
    mail/write +subject=<text> (used to add the subject)
  
  Example:
    > mail/write My first line of the mail
    Mail: Write message started.
    > -My second line of the mail
    Mail: Write line 2 added
    > mail/write +subject=My Subject
    Mail: Write subject set
    > mail/write +list
    Mail: Your write message is:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Subject: My Subject
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1: My first line of the mail
    2: My second line of the mail
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

& mail write forwarding
  Topic: mail write forwarding
  
  To forward mail using the line editor, it takes a bit of reverse logic.
  You must FIRST start writing the message, THEN you specify you want
  to forward it to the player list.
  
    mail/write (used to initialize mail writing and write first line)
    -          (can be used instead of mail/write to write additional lines)
    mail/write +forward=<message #> [@] <player list>
  
  The last line will forward your message to the specified player list and
  include the message# of the message in your mailbox.
  
  See help on mail write +forward for more information on the forward command.

& mail write cmdlist2
  Topic: mail write command list (continued)
  
  The first format (mail/write <message>) will start a new message or append 
  the message to an existing message in the mail editor.  If you have the 
  BRANDY_MAIL toggle set, you may initiate the line editor with 
  'mail player-list=subject'.
  
  To change text, use the +edit sub-command of write to change <old text> to 
  <new text>.  You can't use braces to group the old and new text, but you can 
  use angle brackets (<>) to group the old text. Use +list to check the 
  current status of the message.  See 'help mail line' for information on 
  line editing.
  
  To send the message, or send it as a reply or part of a forwarded message,
  use the +send, +reply, or +forward sub-commands of write.  To cancel
  (erase) the current message in the editor, use the +forget sub-command.
  You can only +reply to and +forward messages in the current folder.
  To add a subject (or remove it) use the +subject option with write.
   
  For examples: help mail write examples.
  
& mail line
  Topic: mail line manipulation
  
  +LIST:
    The +list sub-command includes optional <s#> and <e#> arguments to specify
    the start and end line numbers to list.  Line numbers are always listed,
    but not displayed.
   
  +JUSTIFY:
    Delete line # <#> with the +del sub-command. Justify line <#> as left-
    right-, or center-justified with the +justify sub-command.  Editing a
    line resets the justification to left.  Justification may seem off when
    using +list, as line numbers off-set the lines.
   
  +SPLIT:
    Split line <l#> after <#w> number of words with the +split command.
  
  +JOIN:
    Join line <l#> appended by line <a#> with the +join sub-command.
   
  +INSERT:
    Insert <text> before line <#> with the +insert sub-command.

& mail page
  Command: mail/page <value>
  
  This sub-command sets the length of your pages.  When you specify a
  page number in the status and number sub-commands, the pages are 
  each composed of as many mail message headers as you set with the page
  sub-command.
   
  A value of 0 means to not divide the status and number into separate
  pages (i.e. all message headers are displayed on a single page).

& mail folders
  Topic: mail folders
  
  Mail may be stored in different folders.  Your default folder is the
  'Incoming' folder.  This is the folder where mail will be stored if
  you do not move it to another folder.  If you do not wish to deal with
  folders, you may safely ignore all references to folders, as long as
  you do not use the folder command.
   
  Mail folders may be up to 20 characters in length.  The first letter is
  capitalized, and the rest are in lower case (although you can use any case
  when referring to folders).  Incoming is reserved as the default mail
  folder.
   
  For information on the various folder sub-command, check 'help folder'.
  All mail sub-commands which list your mail or require specifying a
  message number (e.g, status, reply) act on your current folder.  This
  is documented in help on the individual relevant mail sub-commands.

  Topic: mail dtutor (Default Bare-Bone Tutorial)
  
  Welcome to the mail system tutorial.  This will not cover all
  the commands, but it will run you through enough of them to
  get you started with using the mail system.  
  
  The mailsystem has a huge amount of functionality and it is
  our hopes that this will help remove some of the fear and
  confusion you may have.
  
  There will be pages to the tutorial that will allow you
  to interact and try each command at the same time.
  
  Let's make sure you have a mail message to help with
  the tutorial.  Please type this exactly as it shows:
      
    mail me=test subject//test body
  
  We'll explain what that does in the tutorial.

  Welcome to the mail system tutorial (brandy interface).  This will
  not cover all the commands, but will give you a good heads up on
  how to use the mail interface if you come from a MUX background
  with @mail or a mush background and used the Brandy mailer.
  
  First, let's set ourselves up so we can use the brandy interface.
  Please type this exactly as it shows:
  
    @toggle me=brandy_mail
  
  If you wish to remove the toggle at a later date, you may do this
  by doing @toggle me=!brandy_mail.  Help is available on this toggle
  by 'help brandy_mail toggle'.
  
  Ok, first, write a message to yourself, then we can begin the
  tutorial.  To start a new message, type this exactly as shown:

  This is just a quick review of what you can do with the brandy
  mail interface you can't without it.
  
  When toggled, BRANDY_MAIL, you will automatically go into the
  line editor when you do the following commands:
  
    mail <list-of-players>=<subject>                (sending mail)
    mail/send <list-of-players>=<subject>//<body>   (quick sending mail)

  Let's start with checking your mail.  To see if you have
  any mail, please type the following now:
    > mail/quick
  
  You should see the following:
    Mail: You have no current folder
    Mail: 1 Total - 1 new, 0 unread, 0 old, 0 marked, 0 saved mail message(s)
  
  Please note, if you do indeed have extra  mail, you will see something like:
    Mail: You have no current folder
    Mail: 2 Total - 2 new, 0 unread, 0 old, 0 marked, 0 saved mail message(s)
  
  new      : tells you that you have 1 new message.
  unread   : would tell you that you had new messages but disconnected before
             you got to read them
  old      : tells you you have mail you already read
  marked   : tells you you have mail messages marked for deletion
  saved    : tells you you have messages saved from being auto-deleted.

      Mail: You have no current folder
      Mail: 1 Total - 1 new, 0 unread, 0 old, 0 saved mail message(s)
  
  Now, you probably ask, how do you see who the mail is from?  To see who
  the mail is from and the various statistics of it, you would use the command:
    > mail/status
  
  Try it out, you should see mail from yourself.  Output would be like this:

    [N]    - specifies a NEW message.  It can also be 'S'aved, 'U'nread, 'O'ld,
             and 'M'arked (for messages marked for deletion).
             If you disconnected without checking a (N)ew message, it becomes
             an (U)nread message upon your connection.
    ( 1)   - specifies that it is the first message in your mailbox.
    <date> - the date the mail was received.
    Subj:  - the optional subject.  As it's optional it may not be on all mail
    From:  - who sent the mail.
    *      - states if player is connected. (blank if they're not)

  Ok, you now know how to view the mail and list what mail you have, but now
  how do you read it?  Well, there's various ways you can do this.
  If you know it is a NEW message you may type this:
    > mail new
  
  This will read the first NEW mail message you have.  You could also specify
  'unread' instead of 'new' for the first unread message you have.
    > mail unread
  
  Unread is different than New messages by defining a message that was New
  but you had disconnected before you could read it.  So Unread mail is mail
  that you just have not read, but is not New for your current connection.
  
  If you know you have new mail, but are not sure if it's new or unread, you
  may use the 'both' qualifier.  This will read the first New OR Unread
  message, whatever is currently next.
    > mail both 
  
  You may also type the number of the message you want to read.  For example:
    > mail 1
  
  This will read the first mail message in your mail box.
  The output should look like this:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Message #: 1        (Connected)
  Status: NEW         From: <Your Name>
  Date/Time: Wed Jul 14 00:22:57 1999        Size: 4 Bytes

  Topic: Mail Default Tutor (Page 4)
  
  Ok, you now have read your message, you may want to know how to delete it.
  First, you need to mark the message.  There are two ways you can do this
  as well.  First, you can tell mail to delete the last read message and read
  the NEXT message in your mailbox with the 'zap' switch.
    > mail/zap
  
  If you don't have any other messages, or feel more comfortable marking them
  individually, you may use the 'mark' switch.
    > mail/mark 1
  
  This tells the mail system to mark your first message in your mailbox for
  deleting.  Let's verify that it was set.  Type:  mail/status
  
  You should see:
  Mail: You have no current folder
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [M] ( 1) *From: <Your Name>      <Wed Jul 14 00:22:57 1999> (4 Bytes)
            Subj: test subject
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mail: Done
  
  Note:  the '*' before the From: states that you are connected. 
  
  To continue, please type: help mail dtutor5
  
& mail dtutor5
  Topic: Mail Default Tutor (Page 5)
  
  Ok, let's say before you delete the message, you want to reply to the 
  mail.  You may use a few methods.  First, to reply to the sender AND
  include the message in the reply, type this:
    > mail/reply 1*=test reply
  
  You should see:
    Mail: You have a new mail from -> <Your name>
    Mail: Message sent to -> <Your name>
    Mail: Done
   
  Note: If you have the BRANDY_MAIL toggle enabled, this puts you in the editor
  
  Now, lets type mail/status to see your status: 
    > mail/status 
  
  You should see the following:
  Mail: You have no current folder
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [M] ( 1) *From: <Your Name>      <Wed Jul 14 00:22:57 1999> (4 Bytes)
            Subj: test subject
  [N] ( 2) *From: <Your Name>      <Wed Jul 14 00:34:15 1999> (116 Bytes) Reply
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mail: Done
  
  You may use 'mail new', 'mail both', or 'mail 2' to read this message.  
  
  To continue, please type: help mail dtutor6
  
& mail dtutor6
  Topic: Mail Default Tutor (Page 6)
  
  Ok, let's say you just wanted to send the player a message seperate from
  a reply.  You may send mail one of two ways.  You can send it the quick
  and easy method (which will be shown here), or you may use the built-in
  line editor (which is full of features).  If you prefer to use the
  line editor, please refer to 'help mail write' as it is fairly involved
  with it's features.  You also have the BRANDY_MAIL toggle option.
  
  We'll assume you'll want to do this the easy way for now.  To send a 
  message you would type:  
    > mail <player>=<subject>//<body>
  
  The subject is optional and you don't have to specify it.  Let's send
  a message to yourself.  First, without a subject, then with a subject.
  Without a subject:
    > mail me=a test message
  
  With a subject:
    > mail me=a test subject//a test message
  
  With brandy toggle enabled:
    > mail me=a test subject
    > -a test message
    > --
  
  Depending if you did one or both examples, you should have seen you have
  two new messages.  mail/status will list these.
  
  To continue, please type: help mail dtutor7
  
& mail dtutor7
  Topic: Mail Default Tutor (Page 7)
  
  Ok, let's delete those marked messages we have.  You should only have one
  message marked for deletion (unless you went on your own and marked more).
  Now, to purge out the mail you have marked for deletion, please type:
    > mail/delete  
  
  You should have seen the message as follows:
    Mail: 1 message(s) deleted
    Mail: Done
  
  Hey, guess what?  You now have a working knowledge of how to send, read, and
  delete mail.  Congratulations, you have the basics down.  
  
  The mail system is quite extensive with all that it offers, and if something
  you wanted to learn is not in this tutorial, my apologies.  But you will 
  find the help files show examples and are very informative.  If you want
  a quick listing of all the mail commands and syntax/descriptions, please
  type the following:
    > help mail cmdlist
  
  If you want a list of commands used with writing mail with the line editor
  type the following:

  Topic: channels/comsystem
  
  NOTE: If this has been disabled, check 'comhelp' or '+help' for the new one.
  
  The built in channel system that RhostMUSH has is a simple design
  based off standard MUSE com systems.  The format for each is
  as follows:
  
       +chan[nel] +channel-name  (add yourself to a channel)
       +chan[nel] -channel-name  (remove yourself from a channel)
       +chan[nel]                (display all your channels)
       +com channel=who          (see who is on a given channel)
       +com channel=message      ('talk' on a given channel)
  
  (help channel2 to continue)

& @channel2
& +channel2
& channel2
  Topic: channels/comsystem
  
  NOTE: If this has been disabled, check 'comhelp' or '+help' for the new one.
  
  The channel system is case sensitive and does recognize various
  formatting by the following special cases.
  
       :     this poses a message on the channel.
       ;     this possessive poses on the channel.
       "     this speaks on the channel.
  
          Syntax:  +com channel=[format]message
          Example: +com channel=:message (poses on the channel)
  
  All channels cost money (currently 5 gold a pop) except for
  'sting' (a flame-type channel for insults) and 'public' for
  general discussions.  Please note that any insults slung on
  sting REMAIN on sting.  This will be enforced. 
  
& SAFELOG TOGGLE
  Toggle: SAFELOG
  
  When set on a player, it 'cleans' their say output for proper logging.
  Instead of 'You say "blah"' they will see 'So-n-So says "blah"' or
  whatever their @saystring is set as.  This works with SAY and ".
  
  See Also: say, ", @saystring

& VPAGE TOGGLE
  Toggle: VPAGE
  
  When set on a player, it allows them to see the aliases (if existing)
  on the list of players the page went to as well as the person who
  sent the page.  If the alias does not exist, no alias info is 
  displayed.
  
& ACCENTS TOGGLE
  Toggle: ACCENTS
  
  When set on a player, and as long as ZENTY_ANSI has been compiled
  into the RhostMUSH in question, this allows the player to see
  accented strings (umlauts, ticks, tildas, etc).
  
  Accents are displayed by using the accent() function or the %f
  substitution.

& MAILVALIDATE TOGGLE
  Toggle: MAILVALIDATE
  
  This toggle, when set, will do validation of the player lists
  (expanding any aliases) and will not send out any mail if
  ANY target in the mail list is invalid.
  
  The default is it will send mail to all valid players and
  alert you of invalid while continuing through the list.
  
& MONITOR TOGGLE
  Toggle: MONITOR
 
  When set on a player enables the monitoring of connections and 
  disconnections from the mush. This toggle may be set by an
  Architect and above on a player which they control given that the
  player is also Architect or above in level. Additionally it can
  be set by a wizard on any player.
& NOTIFY_LINK TOGGLE
  Toggle: NOTIFY_LINK
  
  When set on a player, it enables them to receive during every periodic
  dump a listing of all unlinked exits that they may have.  They may set
  NOTIFY_LINK on a given exit to suppress this message for that particular
  exit.  This is similar to the FLOATING notification for unlinked rooms.
  
& CPUTIME TOGGLE
  Toggle: CPUTIME
  
  The CPUTIME toggle is designed to aid coders in evaluating the efficiency
  of their code, and to determine if changes which are made are helping
  or hurting their execution time. When this toggle is set on an object, 
  all commands that it executes are profiled by time, evaluation count, 
  function call count, and attribute fetch count. It is recommended that 
  you set the PUPPET flag on your object to enable you to see the profiling 
  information which the CPUTIME toggle presents. You can also set the CPUTIME
  toggle on yourself in which case the PUPPET flag is not necessary.
  
  Example:
    > &TIMEHOG Toy=$timehog:say [words(iter(lnum(1000),lnum(1000)))]
    Set.
    > @toggle Toy=CPUTIME
    Set.
    > @set Toy=PUPPET
    Toy grows ears and can now hear.
    Set.
    > timehog
    Toy says "1040"
    Toy> [CPU:  7.74  EVALS: 2005  FUNCS: 1003  ATRFETCH:    1]
  
  For explanations of what CPU, EVALS, FUNCS, and ATRFETCH is, see CPUTIME2
  
& CPUTIME2
  Toggle: CPUTIME (continued)
  
  CPU         - is the amount of CPU that the given process takes up on 
                the given machine.  The lower the number the better, 
                naturally.
  
  EVALS       - The number of function calls that gets parsed by the mush.
                IE: the number of times the mush has to parse something.
  
  FUNCS       - The total number of MUSH functions called.
  
  ATRFETCH    - The total number of attribute fetches (IE: the number of
                times it has to read any attribute)
                
& VANILLA_ERRORS TOGGLE
  Toggle: VANILLA_ERRORS
 
  When this toggle is set on an object, the mush will show that object
  the normal error message. Otherwise the mush will show something more
  creative.
  
& NO_ANSI_EX TOGGLE
  Toggle: NO_ANSI_EX
 
  When this toggle is set on a player the mush will not hilite things
  such as 'Contents:', 'Key:', etc when you either examine or look. Otherwise
  the mush will insert ansi codes to make the examine or look easier to read.
  
& NO_ANSI_PLAYER TOGGLE
  Toggle: NO_ANSI_PLAYER
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, that target will no longer see
  the ansi color of that player's name if that player had a colorized name.
  
& NO_ANSI_THING TOGGLE
  Toggle: NO_ANSI_THING
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, that target will no longer see
  the ansi color of that thing's name if that thing had a colorized name.
  
& NO_ANSI_ROOM TOGGLE
  Toggle: NO_ANSI_ROOM
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, that target will no longer see
  the ansi color of that room's name if that room had a colorized name.
  
& NO_ANSI_EXIT TOGGLE
  Toggle: NO_ANSI_EXIT
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, that target will no longer see
  the ansi color of that exit's name if that exit had a colorized name.
  
& EXTANSI TOGGLE
  Toggle: EXTANSI
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, that target is allowed to use
  extended ansi (ie: the actual ansi codes) in the @ansiname attribute,
  thereby, allowing multi-color names.  This is done through the command
  '@extansi' in combination with this toggle.  
  
  If you wish pose, say, and @wall to ansifi your name, set the VARIABLE
  @toggle on yourself.
  
  Note: The name of the item in '@extansi' MUST match the name that 
        was given by @name.
  
  See Also: @extansi, ansi()
  
& MAIL_NOPARSE TOGGLE
  Toggle: MAIL_NOPARSE
 
  When this toggle is set, it will surpress the evaluation of
  special characters like %b, %r, or %t when you list out your mail.
  If you want these to be parsed when you list out (proof) your
  mail, then make sure this toggle is not set.
  
  See Also: penn mail toggle, brandy_mail toggle
  
& MAIL_STRIPRETURN TOGGLE
  Toggle: MAIL_STRIPRETURN
  
  When this toggle is set on the player, whenever that player finishes
  writing mail using the BRANDY_MAIL toggle, all lines are combined
  with spaces instead of carrage returns.  This will mimic more how
  Brandy's +mail or Mux's @mail works.
  
  See Also: penn_mail toggle, brandy_mail toggle
  
& BRANDY_MAIL TOGGLE
  Toggle: BRANDY_MAIL
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, whenever that target starts
  a message with 'mail <string1>=<string2>' it will mimic the brandy
  mailer by making string2 be the SUBJECT of the message instead of
  making it the body of the message and immediately sending it 
  (which is the default).  See help on 'mail send' for more info on
  how this works.
  
  See Also: mail send, penn_mail toggle, mail_stripreturn toggle
  
& PENN_MAIL TOGGLE
  Toggle: PENN_MAIL
  
  When this toggle is set on the player, whenever that player sends
  mail quickly (ie: mail[/send] playerlist=subject/target it will
  require only a single '/' and not two '//' like RhostMUSH does
  by default.  This is to help with PENN compatibility.
  
  When sending mail with mail/reply, mail, or mail/forward, the
  BRANDY_MAIL toggle will take precidence.
  
  See Also: brandy_mail toggle, mail_stripreturn toggle
  
& ZONE_AUTOADD TOGGLE
  Toggle: ZONE_AUTOADD
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, whenever that target creates
  anything new (via @dig, @open, etc), that target will inherit the
  FIRST zone that the target belongs to.  If the target has no zones
  or if this toggle is not set, the zone addition is ignored.  If the
  target is also toggled ZONE_AUTOADDALL, that toggle will take
  presidence.
  
  See Also: ZONE_AUTOADDALL
  
& ZONE_AUTOADDALL TOGGLE
  Toggle: ZONE_AUTOADDALL
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, whenever that target creates
  anything new (via @dig, @open, etc), that target will inherit ALL
  of the zones that the target belongs to.  If the target has no zones
  or if this toggle is not set, the zone addition is ignored.  This
  toggle has presidence over ZONE_AUTOADD.
  
  See Also: ZONE_AUTOADD
  
& MUXPAGE TOGGLE
  Toggle: MUXPAGE
  
  When this toggle is set on the target, they may use 'page <message>' to
  page the last person(s) they paged.  This is done for MUX/TM3 compatibility.
  This toggle, in no way, affects 'lp', 'rp', or 'mrp'.
  
  See Also: lpage, rpage, mrpage  
  
& ZONEPARENT 
  Flag: ZONEPARENT([y])
  
  This flag specifies if the ZMO is to 'distribute' or allow its attributes
  to be inherited to the things that belong to its zone.  Anything that
  you do not wish to inherit its attributes, if it is set ZONEPARENT, must
  be set NOZONEPARENT.  Alternately, individual attributes may be specified
  to not be inheritable if set NO_INHERIT.
  
  See Also: NOZONEPARENT, @set2
  
& NOZONEPARENT TOGGLE
  Toggle: NOZONEPARENT
  
  Specifies if the target DOES NOT inherit attributes from it's ZMO object(s) 
  that it belongs to.  Each zone master object (ZMO) that is intended to 
  inherit attributes, must be set ZONEPARENT.  Alternately, individual
  attributes may be set to not be inheritable if set NO_INHERIT.
  
  See Also: ZONEPARENT, NOGLOBPARENT, @set2
  
& NOGLOBPARENT TOGGLE
  Toggle: NOGLOBPARENT
  
  Specifies if the target DOES NOT inherit attributes from the specified 
  global parent.  This specific global parent does not effect @parent and
  may not be desired on every object.  The NOGLOBPARENT toggle is by
  default wizard settable only.
  
  See Also: NOZONEPARENT, @set2
  
& KEEPALIVE TOGGLE
  Toggle: KEEPALIVE
  
  This toggle, when set on a valid player, will enable a NOP telnet code
  to be transmitted to the target player.  This is useful for keeping
  timed connections alive for their full duration.  Especially handy
  for broken routers, NATs, firewalls, or other issues.
  
  Note: Some rare clients, depending on version, does not handle the
        KEEPALIVE toggle cleanly, and will garble input randomly
        from its use.  If you run into commands seemingly not working,
        then you may need to remove this toggle.
  
& VARIABLE TOGGLE
  Toggle: VARIABLE
  
  Specifies that the target exit is a 'variable' exit and that it will
  parse the @exitto attribute for it's destination location and not where
  it is currently linked to.
  
  If a player sets the VARIABLE toggle on himself, then all ansi via
  Cname()/%k will show up when that player @walls, poses, or uses say.
    
  See Also: variable exits, @exitto
  
& IC
  Flag: IC([I])
 
  (*note this flag is meaningless on RhostMUSH*)
  When set on a player or object, denotes that they are In-Character and 
  therefore subject to inclusion in tinyplots, etc, and whatever they
  say or do will be interpreted as if their character was doing or saying it.
  If this flag is not set, whatever the they say or do is to be interpreted
  as if it is either the real life person talking, or some mixture of the
  character and the real life person that is not 100% In-Character and should
  not be taken as being in character.
 
  When set on a room it denotes that the room is fair ground for roleplaying.
  When set on a zonemaster it denotes that the entire zone is fair ground for
  roleplaying (This is not yet implemented).
 
  See Also: help COMBAT
  
& COMBAT
  Flag: COMBAT([X])
 
  (*note this flag is meaningless on RhostMUSH*)
  When this flag is set on a player or object AND the IC flag is set, it 
  denotes that they are willing to participate in combat. If this flag is
  set on a room it denotes that the room is fair ground for combat to occur.
  If this flag is set on a zonemaster, it denotes that all the rooms in the
  zone are fair ground for combat. (this is not yet implemented)
  
  See Also: IC
  
& ZONEMASTER
  Flag: ZONEMASTER([Z])
 
  When this flag is set on a room or object it specifies it as the control
  object for a zone. A zone is defined in two ways. First a zone is a 
  group of ROOMS that create a physical geographic area (need not be 
  connected, but would be nice). These rooms are zoned to the zone master
  and whenever anyone enters a command that is not matched on an object 
  local to them, the zone master is searched for the command. If the command
  is found on the zone master then it is executed with the zone master as %!
  and the player/object that entered the command as %#.
 
  A zone is also defined as a group of rooms/objects/exits/players who
  are zoned to the zone master. These objects may be modified and controlled
  by anyone who passes the ZoneWizLock on the zonemaster.
  
  If the item is also set ZONECONTENTS, this flag can not be removed without
  the ZONECONTENTS flag being removed first.  Also, if there are existing 
  zones on the Zone Master, this flag can not be removed.
   
  See Also: ZONES, IC, COMBAT, ZONECONTENTS, @zone
  
& ZONECONTENTS
  Flag: ZONECONTENTS([z])
  
  When this flag is set on a room which is also set ZONEMASTER, then that
  zonemaster's contents will be searched for any matching $command.
  This will, in effect, work like a mini-master room.
  
  The ZONEMASTER flag must be set before this flag can be set.
  
  See Also: ZONES, IC, COMBAT, ZONEMASTER, @zone

& USER ATTRIBUTES
  User attributes are defined as personally designed or created attribute
  names by the user.  These can be mostly anything you want, up to the
  length of the current SBUF (32 or 64 characters) and starting with
  a-z, A-Z, ~ (if configured), # (if configured), or _ (wiz only).
  
  Attributes may not start with any other character, but after the initial
  character they are able to contain most characters up to the SBUF
  lenght.
  
  You can set these attributes with the & (or clustered >) command, or by
  using @set or set().  Individual help for each of those is available.
  
  Attribute permissions may not be possible to set based on locks that may
  exist, control of the object you're trying to set it on, or global 
  permissions prefixes that may be established.
  
  See Also: &, >, @set, set(), @cpattr, @mvattr
  
& DIFFERENCES
  First we'll touch on the TinyMUX differences.
  1) Paging.
     In mux, you can type: page <player-list>=topic, but you need to 
     surround players with spaces in their name within quotes.
  
     In Rhost, you can type: page <player-list>=topic, but if you intend
     to page people with spaces in their names, the first character MUST
     start with a comma.  i.e.:  page ,player1, player with space = message
     
     You may also @toggle yourself MUXPAGE to have paging work the same.
    
  2) Re-paging
     In mux, you could do page <message> to re-page a player.
  
     In Rhost, you have to use 'lp <message> to re-page a player.  You
     may also use 'rp <message>' to re-page a player who last paged you.
     They can be used interactively from each other.
  
     You may also @toggle yourself MUXPAGE to have paging work the same.
  
  3) Mail
     In mux, you could do @mail <player-list>=<subject> then use '-' to
     write new lines and '--' to send.
  
     In Rhost, you need to first set the BRANDY_MAIL toggle.  To set this,
     type:  @toggle me=brandy_mail (use !brandy_mail to unset)
     You can now use:  mail <player-list>=<subject> then use '-' to
     write new lines and '--' to send like you're used to.
  
  { type 'help differences2' for tinymush differences. }
  
& DIFFERENCES2
  Welp, there's not many differences to be honest.  However, as most TinyMUSH's
  use the brandy mailer, you may use the mail method above to make a syntax
  that you'd be compatible with.
  
  For PENN, there's some subtle differences.     
  1) Mail
     In Penn you can do:  mail <user-list>=subject/body
     
     In Rhost you need to do: mail <user-list>=subject//body
     (notice the need of two //'s)
  
  For all other platforms:
  1) BBS
     Rhost's hardcoded bbs system is *totally* different than any other
     system.  Softcode interfaces can be coded to make it into a more
     familiar interface if desired, as it is a very powerful system.
  
  2) Flags
     Rhost's flags have different letters for the staff.  Anything ported
     with softcode will probably need to be twinked.  However, all the
     functions/commands should work similiarilly to what you're used to.
  
  3) Com system.
     Rhost's current hardcoded comsystem is very archiac.  I'd suggest
     a softcoded alternative until a better one is coded.  And yes, it
     is both in the works and should be backward compatible to both
     PENN *and* MUX.
  
& MAILQUICK()
  Function: mailquick(<player>[[,<folder>][,<type>]])
  
  This function has a number of uses.  If the type is zero (0) (the default)
  then it will return the values that 'mail/quick' returns.  If the value
  for type is a '1', it returns the 3 values that mux's mail() returns.  If
  the value for type is a '2', it returns the total messages you have in your
  box.  '3' gives you a modified version of '1'.  The default folder is 
  your incoming box.
  
  Examples:
    > mail/quick me
    Mail: 4 Total - 1 new, 0 unread, 2 old, 1 marked, 0 saved mail message(s) 
    > say mailquick(me)
    You say "4 1 0 2 1 0"
    > say mailquick(me,,1)
    You say "3 1 1"
    > say mailquick(me,,2)
    You say "4"

& save
  RhostMUSH, unlike lp's, merc's, diku's or similiar mud derivitives, does not
  have a 'save' option.  Your character, upon creation, is automatically saved.
  Everything you do, whenever you do it, is also automatically saved.  So just
  have fun, relax, and enjoy your time on.   Leave the saving to us :)
  
& HASRXLEVEL()
  Function: hasrxlevel(<target>,<level>)
  
  Returns 1 if <target> has the specified Rx Level. You must control <target>.
  If the level does not exist, or you do not control the target, it returns
  a '#-1'.
  
  Example:
    > say hasrxlevel(me,real)
    You say '1'.
  
  See Also: hastxlevel(), rxlevel(), txlevel(), listrlevels(), chkreality()
  
& HASTXLEVEL()

  <target>.  If no levels are listed, nothing is returned.  If you do not 
  control the target, or if the target does not exist, '#-1' is returned.
  
  You may specify a value to set or unset if this SIDEEFFECT feature
  is enabled.  The enactor MUST be set SIDEFX for this to work.  You
  must have permission to set reality levels to use this.  Use 
  listrlevels() or @list rlevel to see the levels you can set.
  
  Example:
    > say rxlevel(me)
    You say 'Real'.
    > say rxlevel(me, !real)
    You say ""
    > say rxlevel(me)
    You say ""
  
  See Also: hasrxlevel(), hastxlevel(), txlevel(), listrlevels(), chkreality()
  
& CHKREALITY()
  Function: chkreality(<victom>, <target>)

& REGEXPS
  Topic: REGEXPS
  
  (This help text is largely from PennMUSH, with permission)
  
  The majority of matching in MUSH is done with wildcard ("globbing")
  patterns. There is a second type of matching, using regular expressions,
  that is available in certain circumstances.
  
  For attributes that are $-commands or ^-listen-patterns, setting that
  attribute "regexp" (with '@set <object>/<attribute>=regexp') causes
  patterns to be matched using regular expressions rather than
  globbing. In addition, the function regmatch() performs regular
  expression matching.
  
  In a regular expression match, the substring of the string which matched
  the regexp pattern is %0; %1 through %9 are the substrings of the string
  which matched parenthesized expressions within the regexp pattern.

& REGEXPS2
  Topic: REGEXPS2 (continued)
  
  Regular expressions are extremely useful when you want to enforce
  a data type. For example, if you have a command where you want a
  player to enter a string and a number ('+setnum <player>=<number>',
  for example), you might do it like this:
  
  &DO_NUM Command Object=$^\+setnum (.+)=([0-9]+)$: @va me=Data: %1 = %2
  @set Command Object/DO_NUM = regexp
  
  Then, '+setnum cookies=30' would set VA to "Data: cookies = 30".
  This eliminates your having to check to see if the player entered
  a number, since the regular expression matches only numbers.
  Furthermore, the '+' guarantees that there needs to be at least
  one character there, so a player can't enter '+setnum cookies='
  or '+setnum =10' or similarly malformed input.
  
  The '+' sign in the command has to be escaped out, or it is taken as
  a regexp token. Furthermore, the pattern-match has to be anchored
  with ^ and $, or something like 'try +setnum cookies=30 now' would
  also match. Regexps are case-sensitive; wildcard globbing is not.
  
  Regular expression syntax is explained in 'help regexp syntax'.

& REGEXP SYNTAX
  Topic: REGEXP SYNTAX
  
  RhostMUSH uses PCRE for its regular expression engine.  PCRE is an
  open source library of functions to support regular expressions whose
  syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl
  5 language.  The text below is excerpted from its man page. PCRE
  was written by Philip Hazel <ph10@cam.ac.uk>, and is Copyright (c)
  1997-1999 University of Cambridge, England. You can find it at
     ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
  
  (Note that in RhostMUSH, if the regular expression is in an eval'd
  context (like an argument to regmatch), you'll have to do a lot
  of escaping to make things work right. One way to escape an argument
  like %0 is: regeditall(%0,\\W,\\$0) or similar).
  
  A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject
  string from left to right. Most characters stand for themselves in a
  pattern, and match the corresponding characters in the subject.

  There are two different sets of meta-characters: those  that
  are  recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square
  brackets, and those that are recognized in square  brackets.
  Outside square brackets, the meta-characters are as follows:
  
       \      general escape character with several uses
       ^      assert start of subject
       $      assert end of subject
       .      match any character except newline
       [      start character class definition
       |      start of alternative branch ("or")
       (      start subpattern
       )      end subpattern
       ?      0 or 1 quantifier (after a unit to quantify)
              or, minimal match (after a quantifier)
              or,  extends the meaning of ( after a (
       *      0 or more quantifier
       +      1 or more quantifier

& REGEXP SYNTAX3
  Topic: REGEXP SYNTAX3 (continued)
  Part of a pattern that is in square  brackets  is  called  a
  "character class". It matches any character listed in the class.
  In a character class, the only metacharacters are:
  
       \      general escape character
       ^      negate the class, if the first character in the class
       -      indicates character range (e.g. A-Z, 0-4)
   [:NAME:]   A symbol for a group of characters that can vary
              according to the language the mush is using.
              See 'help regexp classes' for more information.
       ]      terminates the character class
  
  A backslash will escape most metacharacters, and can turn
  some normal characters into generic character types:
  
       \d     any decimal digit
       \D     any character that is not a decimal digit
       \s     any whitespace character
       \S     any character that is not a whitespace character
       \w     any "word" character (letter, digit, or underscore)
       \W     any "non-word" character

  A backlash can also two useful assertions -- conditions that
  must be met at a particular point in a match:
  
       \b     word boundary
       \B     not a word boundary
  
  A word boundary is a position in the  subject  string  where the
  current character and the previous character do not both match \w or
  \W (i.e. one matches \w and  the  other  matches \W),  or the start
  or end of the string if the first or last character matches \w,
  respectively.

  Quantifiers specify repetition of characters. Three are available:
       *    match 0 or more of whatever came before
       +    match 1 or more of whatever came before
       ?    match 0 or 1 of whatever came before
   
  (In theory, you can match m-n of whatever came before with {m,n},
  but the MUSH parser makes it impossible to use {}'s)
   
  Quantifiers are usually greedy -- they match as much as possible.
  Adding a ? after a quantifier causes it to match as little as
  possible instead.
  
{continued in 'help regexp syntax6'}

& REGEXP SYNTAX6
  Topic: REGEXP SYNTAX6 (continued)
  
  Outside a character class, a backslash followed by  a  digit greater
  than  0  (and  possibly  further  digits) is a back reference to a
  capturing subpattern  earlier  (i.e.  to  its left)  in  the  pattern,
  provided there have been that many previous capturing left parentheses.
  A back reference matches whatever actually matched the  capturing
  subpattern in the current subject string, rather than anything matching
  the subpattern itself. So the pattern
  
    (sens|respons)e and \1ibility
  
  matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and  responsibility",  but
  not  "sense  and  responsibility".
  
{continued in 'help regexp syntax7'}

& REGEXP SYNTAX7
  Topic: REGEXP SYNTAX7 (continued)
  
  An assertion is  a  test  on  the  characters  following  or
  preceding  the current matching point that does not actually consume
  any characters.  There  are  two kinds:  those that look ahead of the
  current position in the subject string, and those that look behind it.
  
  An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way, except that  it
  does not cause the current matching position to be changed. Lookahead
  assertions start with  (?=  for  positive assertions and (?! for
  negative assertions. For example, Lookbehind assertions start with
  (?<=  for  positive  assertions and (?<! for negative assertions.
  
  Assertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns, and may not
  be  repeated,  because  it makes no sense to assert the same thing
  several times. If an assertion contains capturing subpatterns within it,
  these are always counted for the purposes of numbering the capturing
  subpatterns  in  the  whole pattern.

& REGEXP CLASSES
  Topic: REGEXP CLASSES
  
  In a character class, you can use a number of additional keywords
  that match certain types of characters. The keywords are enclosed in
  [: and :], within the character class, so the whole thing looks like
  [[:NAME:]].
  
  These keywords can be mixed with other things in the character class,
  like [ab[:digit:]], which will match 'a, 'b', or a digit. [:^NAME:]
  reverses the meaning of NAME - it expands to everything but characters
  that would match [:NAME:].
  
  Some recognized NAMEs:
   digit, for numbers. [[:digit:]] is the same as \d.
    [[:^digit:]] is the same as \D.
   alpha, for letters. alnum, for numbers and letters.
   lower, for lower-case letters. upper, for upper-case letters.
   word, for word characters. [[:word:]] is the same as \w.
    [[:^word:]] is the same as \W.
   space, for whitespace characters. [[:space:]] is the same as \s.
    [[:^space:]] is the same as \S.

& REGEXP CLASSES2
  Topic: REGEXP CLASSES2 (continued)
  
  These keywords (Or the corresponding \codes) should be used instead of
  explicit ranges where possible to improve portability. For example,
  [A-Za-z] and [[:alpha:]] are not the same thing in languages with accented
  characters. There are other keywords, but the ones listed are the most
  useful.
  
  Examples:
  > say regmatch(foo_bar, lit(^[[:word:]]+$))
  You say "1"
  > say regmatch(foo bar, lit(^[[:word:]]+$))
  You say "0"

  The regexp pattern '.' is equivalent to the wildcard '?'; it matches
  one and only one of an arbitrary character.
  
  The regexp pattern '.+' is equivalent to the wildcard '*'; it matches
  one or more arbitrary characters. To match zero or more arbitrary
  characters, the regexp pattern is '.*'.
  
  To match a string of numbers, use:       [0-9]+    or \d+
  To match a string of letters only, use:  [A-Za-z]+ or \w+

& revisions
  All credits to players, codebases, or other is presented in the RHOST.CHANGES
  file in the readme directory in the source distribution.  The credits are too
  diverse and well too detailed to be sufficient as a small snippit in online
  help.
  
  Beginning with Rhost 3.9.1, the Development team has tracked all changes to
  the Rhost system in the helpfiles, so that users may see what changes have
  been made with each revision.  Each change is detailed in bullet-point format
  in a helpfile specific to its revision, along with the alias for the 
  developer who completed the change. 
  
  Do note, effort was done to backport help as much as possible all the way
  back to the initial 3.2.4 rewrite that started Rhost for what it is today.
  
  Any versioning of Rhost version 1.0 through 3.0 was sadly lost to time.
  
  The developers who may appear in these files are:
    ASH - Ashen-Shugar      * AMB - Ambrosia            EEH - Noltar
    KRK - Loki                LNS - Lensman             ODN - Odin
