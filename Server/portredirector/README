This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush
to a new site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do
this you would type the following:

                  cc portmsg.c -o portmsg

if 'cc' is not defined, try the following:

                 gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg

To launch the application, you would then type:

                 ./portmsg <file> <port>

Where <port> is the port where the mush used to run at.

Where <file> is the file displayed to those connecting.

'moved.txt' is provided as an example for <file>, but will still
need to be edited to contain the new location.
