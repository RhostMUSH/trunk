The 'retired' directory has older image files if you're interested

Please use the netrhost.conf file with the database as they're linked.

The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db

This is a minimal db with basic 'features' built in.

Copy the txt files into the Rhost's txt directory off game.
    cp txt/* ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt

mkindx the files (substitute FILENAME with the filename)
    cd ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt
    ../mkindx FILENAME.txt FILENAME.indx
 
Steps:
1) Using the Startmush utility for the first time, select the load db method

--- or ---

1) copy the netrhost.conf file into the games directory
2) make any relevant changes you wish
3) db_load the flatfile
   - go into the game directory
   - type: ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new
4) Startmush as expected
